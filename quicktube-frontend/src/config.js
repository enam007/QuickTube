        text: "Good afternoon. We are once again back in session. If all of you'll take your seats. We'll get started with the program. The, for this afternoon, uh, James Cooley with the Department of Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and the director of op operations will be here. James, I think you're here. Nope, you are. Thank y'all for coming and we're gonna turn the program over to you. Thanks so much. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can now? Thanks. Thank you. Alright. Appreciate y'all having us here today. Um, along with me today to help out with this presentation is Anya Rasinski. Uh, she is the chief of our Watershed Protection branch. Um, and she's gonna be introducing a couple people, uh, from the Watershed Protection branch a little bit later in the presentation. But I also also like to, uh, to, uh, introduce you all to Tilden bi Tilden. If you wanna stand up. Tilden's, our district manager, uh, in our West Central District located here in Macon. Uh, so that's a resource that we have, a local resource. Um, if you ever have any business with E P D or ever have any questions for a local issue, uh, Tilden is the person that you could reach out to. Um, today we're gonna, I'm gonna be talking to you guys about, uh, give you an update on Solar Farms. I did a presentation last year and, uh, there was a lot of interest in it. So I wanna give you an update on where we're at with Solar Farms in Georgia. And Anya is going to be talking about frost protection and, uh, ag well permitting. Um, so the topics that I'm gonna cover today basically is a recap of, of what we covered last year, um, what e p D to has done to address some of the challenges that I presented to you last year. Um, challenges that we're gonna, that we're gonna face moving forward, um, and what's been done to get ahead of these challenges. But I've also been asked by a lot of you, uh, as well as our director and deputy director, have been asked, uh, is there anything that we can do to help you? So today I'm gonna talk a little bit about, uh, what you all can do to help us as we address the challenges moving forward with Solar Farms. Uh, presented this to you last year. This is what you see on the news, the concept versus reality. Uh, this is the concept that you see, but at this time, last year, this was the reality we were seeing on the ground. So we were pretty far apart. Uh, and what was being presented to us is clean power, um, versus, uh, where we were, some of the challenges we were facing was, uh, the large size of these projects. Um, as you can see, there's some pretty big equipment, uh, in the middle of this, but you, it, it doesn't even look like Tonka toys. Um, just very massive sites. Uh, some of these are, uh, some of the things that we were dealing with was the inaccessibility to maintenance once the solar panels were installed. Um, we talked about this. As you can see in this picture, there were, uh, there's reels forming or little ditches that form in between the rows of solar panels. Uh, and once these solar panels go in, there's only two options. You either fix this by hand or you have to pull the solar panels back out. Um, so it's, it's an issue that we're trying to address. Um, this is another picture from a different angle of those reels running off the site. Um, this is an example of what we were seeing of undersized sediment storage at some of these sites for their sediment basins. Um, and this was, uh, significant sediment release from one of the sites. Because of this. I showed you all this picture last year. This is further down river from that site. This was a release that was into the Broad River, uh, from this site. Um, and this is a separate site, one that I showed you earlier. But, uh, an update on this site that I showed you last year. This one was actually awarded $135 million, uh, in a Federal Clean Water Act lawsuit. Uh, I know most of you're probably aware of that, but in case some of you weren't, uh, that's an update on that site. Uh, this was some sediment that was coming from that site. Uh, so what has EP done to address some of these challenges? So the general permit for construction that, that these need to fall under or will fall under or do fall under the G R 100,001, um, requires any site that's gonna construct or disturb over more than 50 acres at one time. They need to get additional approval from E P D, uh, prior to commencing that construction activity. So we've established an additional, uh, review criteria and specific design components for these large scale sites. Um, some of the things that we look at are applicant's previous compliance history, uh, the technical justification of why they need to disturb over 50 acres at one time, the total disturbed acres, uh, soil types, on site topography. Um, there, uh, any state waters within 200 feet, um, and any impaired stream segments, uh, on the property are within one mile upstream in the same watershed, uh, of that property. And then the proximity to sensitive areas such as drinking water, intakes, marshes, uh, trout streams, et cetera. These are some of the specific design components that, that we're currently, uh, kind of getting a feel for. We're working with the industry, kind of develop the dynamic process moving forward on, on how we can get, uh, in front of these, but at, at the same time, still allow solar to come because we know it's a good thing, uh, but we want to do it responsibly. So we're working with them on, on how we can size these things a little more responsibly, uh, to get vegetation established on these before, uh, they put the solar panels in. So these are just a couple of the criteria we've come up with. Uh, we try to get 'em to break up the site using natural features or existing land characteristics, drainage basins. Uh, an example of one site we've done, we've recently done down in South Georgia, there was some wetlands kind of separated out, if you will, kind of like this, like an L. And there was an area here, there was an area here, and there was an area here they wanted to develop. So we broke it up into three segments. Uh, so they would only be, they would only have basically one sensitive area or one side of the property with a sensitive area on at a time. Uh, so they could better address those issues. And, and it worked, it worked well. Um, increased temporary sediment basins. Uh, so these are some additional BMPs that, that we're getting 'em to incorporate. Basically doubling the size of their, uh, sediment basins on site. Um, having the design professional that designed their plan come out more, uh, more often to check on the site, to make sure that, that the plan is continuing to be implemented in accordance with the design professionals design, uh, and to make sure that, that, that the best management practices that the design professional designed are continuing to work like they design conceptually. So they're checking to make sure their concept is a reality as far as their erosion control. Um, and then the third thing is, uh, install post-construction BMPs, uh, which remove 80% total, uh, suspended solids, uh, is outlined in the Georgia storm water manual. And then we have a list of six, uh, additional BMPs that they can pick one of those from. Um, these are, these are some of the more specific, uh, design components that,",

        text: "that I was talking about a little bit earlier. But essentially big picture, what we wanna see happen is they need to get some vegetation established on these sites before they put the solar panels in, because that was one, as I showed you earlier, that was one of the big areas where we were seeing a problem is, uh, vegetation was not being established on these sites, uh, before they put the solar panels in. And then there was just, uh, several, uh, hurdles to come over or challenges to face once they put those solar panels in. So we're trying to make sure that they get some grass established before they put the solar panels in. And so this is an example of where we are now. Uh, so the, the stuff I was showing you earlier is where we were last year, challenges we're facing, but this is an example of a site where we're getting them to establish vegetation, uh, before they put the solar panels in. Uh, and as you can tell, uh, even from the stormwater pond, uh, over to the left, uh, this appears to be working a lot better, uh, than some of the other sites. So, so we think we've made, uh, significant progress in this. We've, we've gotten some good feedback, uh, from some of the solar groups that, that, that we're working with, that I think we've formed a good partnership with them, uh, and the understanding that, that, that they want to do, do this, but do it responsibly. Um, so challenges moving forward, uh, as I'm, I'm sure everybody in this room is aware of the Inflation Reduction Act and the 30%, uh, tax incentive that that is available until 2032. Um, and this has provided solar companies a big incentive to expedite solar siting. Um, there is gonna be an increased number of out-of-state, uh, slash out country contractors, not familiar with Georgia's regulations, uh, and various ecosystems as a result of this. Um, but the total disturbed acreage in the next five years for solar development is estimated to be somewhere between 50 and a hundred thousand, uh, acres in Georgia. Um, and E P D currently doesn't have the staff, uh, to keep up with this. Um, so what have we done to address some of these, uh, challenges moving forward? The Georgia Utility Scale solar siting initiative partnership was created, uh, to develop a comprehensive guidance document, uh, regarding best management practices for solar, uh, development in Georgia. And, uh, the pointers, I don't think the pointer works. Yeah, you can't see, but you can see up here. These are the, the, the partners that work together, uh, to develop this, this best management practice, uh, guidance document. Um, it's called Best Management Practices for Siting and Design of Responsible Solar Development in Georgia. Uh, we have a BMP conference slash workshop scheduled in September, uh, that's been arranged by Georgia Power to meet, uh, it's a, it's part of their, their their pre-bid. Um, so they've arranged for us to meet with them and have a workshop to talk about best management practices, some of the, the recommendations, and then some of the requirements in Georgia. So that, that, that all these people that are gonna be bidding on these solar projects understand, uh, exactly what they're getting into and, and the different ecosystem types that we have in Georgia. Um, and then as the solar farms evolve and BMPs become, uh, different BMPs become available, or we discover more effective BMPs, they'll be incorporated into this document. It'll almost be a living document, and it will be located on D and R'S website. Um, so what can you all do to help? Uh, on July 1st, 2003, house Bill 2 85 became effective, and I won't go through all this, but essentially there was an $80 per disturbed acre fee associated with construction activities in Georgia. Um, in areas where there is a local issuing authority, 40 of that $80 per acre goes to the local government. Um, and if you look at the, the estimates that we have right now on land disturbance in Georgia over the next five years, there's gonna be an increase, uh, in Georgia's revenue between $600,001.2 million a year in, in fees collected for this program. Um, and in addition to that, there's gonna be an additional two to $400,000 a year going to local governments. Um, you can see here how I came up with this, uh, in the slides, but this money goes into the general fund that's collected by a, and this goes into the general fund, and it must be reappropriated by the legislature. And as I noticed in a lot of your bios, that there's a lot of people on appropriations in this room. So, uh, we would appreciate any help you can get there. Um, but this is an example of the last five years fees collected. Um, 2018, like the actual physical year, 2018 is when we started seeing kind of a uptick in solar. And as you can see, the trends are kind of, uh, mirrored here and the fees that we've been collecting, uh, over the last, uh, five years. And unlike, uh, some of the other industries and some of the other stuff that we saw earlier, uh, covid didn't, uh, slow this down. Uh, it may have slowed it down, but it didn't stop construction. Uh, in Georgia, as you can see, the trend is still going upward. And based on the numbers we've seen, uh, that's, that curve's gonna have a lot more upward trend in the next five years. Um, but again, like I said, the, in the beginning there was a concept versus reality, but if we keep working together, uh, with the legislature as well as the, uh, the industry, uh, I think we can all work together and make this concept a reality. And, and I appreciate all y'all support so far, but I'm gonna turn it over to Anya, and then if y'all have questions at the end, we'll just take questions if that's okay. That's chairman. That's Great. Thank you, Uhhuh. All right. Thank you, Jim. Uh, thank you everyone for giving me some time today to talk about agricultural water withdrawal, and I'm very fortunate to have with me two, uh, fantastic people. Uh, Mr. Cliff Lewis, who is the head of our Ag Permitting program. Cliff, if you don't mind standing up, and Ms. Margie Rockmore, who is the head of our ag metering program. Thank you, Margie. These are two very important folks to know for Ag water withdrawal. So what I'll spend my time with today is provide a little bit of background, uh, talking about agricultural water withdrawal, particularly in southwest Georgia. Uh, then I'll go into frost protection permitting, and then I'll wrap it up with some discussion of the Habitat Conservation Plan. Based on the topics discussed, uh, based on topics requested, I'm really focusing on the agricultural water withdrawal suspension we have in southwest Georgia. We also have some limits on Florida and aquifer use in southeast Georgia, which Representative Williams mentioned earlier. I'm happy to talk about that later if there is interest in that as well. So, focusing here on the subject area, the Flint River is extensive. It starts under Atlanta Jackson Hartfield International Airport, and it goes all the way down to where it meets the Chattahoochee River, making Lake Seminole at the very southwest corner of the state. And the area of particular interest is called the Lower Flint, uh, really kinda that bottom of the basin. And it is unique because it is also geologically unique. There's an area outlined here, uh, on the map in pink, uh, that's called sub area four. Sub Area four is the place where the Florida and Aquifer and the Flint River and its tributaries are really hydraulically connected. That means if you pull water out of the Florida and aquifer, you can see a lower water level in the Flint River, or its tributary. They're that closely tied. And this is a part of the state that's been very significant for agriculture for a really long time. And we started to see agriculture really boom in the 1970s and 1980s as you started seeing more and more irrigation put in place. And as we started to see more agricultural water use, E P D developed an Ag Water Withdrawal Permitting program. This started in 1988, and initially our permits were very, very simple. They didn't even have an expiration date. And so we were issuing permits like this for about 11 years. And then Director Harold re said, stop, we've gotta wait a minute and put a moratorium on permitting. This was driven by a couple of different things. One was that we were in a multi-year drought. Another is that there had been, uh, interest from fish and wildlife on some endangered species, endangered muss that were found in the Flint River and in that area. And there were also some concerns about the effects of irrigation, really understanding the effects of irrigation on water levels, both in the Florida and aquifer, but also in the Flint River and in its tributaries, the E p d director had the statutory authority to do this, because if you have permits that kind of extend indefinitely, you can put a pause in permitting to develop a plan that's going to guide permitting moving forward, which is what E P D then spent the next seven years doing. And we developed the Flint River Basin Plan in 2006, which identified areas of different levels of hydraulic connection within the basin. You've got the red areas where there's a really tight connection between the Florida and aquifer and surface water. You've got a yellow area, which is a little bit less connected, but still quite connected. And then that green zone where there isn't nearly as much connection between the Florida and aquifer and the surface waters. And that 2006 plan basically laid out how permitting would move forward, that there'd be no new permits issued, and that red zone that there'd be some permitting in the yellow and green zones, uh, with some additional considerations to make sure that we were being protective of the water resource. And this continued until 2012 when then Director Judd Turner issued a suspension for withdrawals from the Florida and Aquifer, uh, in sub area four, as well as from, uh, surface waters in the lower Flint basin. And again, this was response to a multi-year drought and some concerns about the effects of, uh, water use on surface water flows in that area. Concerns about endangered species, a lot of things kind of came together all at once. And that suspension was intended to be reviewed annually by November of each year. E p D was supposed to review the technical information and then come up with a recommendation for what we should do. Should we maintain the suspension? Should we modify it in some way? What are the next steps? Well, there wasn't a lot to do in November, 2012. The suspension just went into effect in July. So we didn't have a lot of new data. And before we got to November, 2013, uh,",

        text: "we were sued by Florida in the Supreme Court over our water use. So attention really focused on that. We were also very hesitant to develop a new permitting regime, uh, understanding that there was an active Supreme Court case and a lot of regulatory uncertainty. Instead, we focused on improving our data, improving our metering program, uh, and really thinking toward the future, what can be the next things that we do for water management. So this continued for a number of years until 2021, when the Supreme Court ca Court found unanimously in Georgia's favor, which was a great victory for Georgia. Now, the Special Master and the Supreme Court admonished that Georgia really needed to pay attention to its water use. We had to continue to be good stewards of the water resource. Um, but it was overall a very good thing for the state. And at that point, we were able to really start thinking, now, where do we move next? And a big place we wanted to move next was to start implementing some different tools, some different projects that would help us protect flows in the Flint River. And one of those was, um, a ARPA funded project with Albany State's, Georgia Water Planning and Policy Center on switching from service water intakes to a lower aquifer, not the Florida, but either the Clayborne or the Cretaceous during times of drought. So we had this great, nearly $50 million grant to start implementing those deeper wells and developing a way to swap. But that wasn't where we wanted to stop. There were other things that could be done for farmers in that region and for the water resource in that region. And one of those was to look at frost protection permitting pause. So frost protection is when you apply a huge amount of water onto, directly onto the plants as temperatures start to approach freezing. And this is critically important for citrus and berry crops. It's absolutely necessary for managing that frost risk. And it was an option that we've seen utilized in different parts of Georgia. But because the 2012 suspension did not allow any new or modified permits in the suspension area from the Florida and or surface water, it wasn't something that our farmers in southwest Georgia could use. So we started to look, would frost protection permitting be an appropriate next step? And we came to the answer that yes, it would be basically you're expecting frost protection to be used during the recharge season. So during the winter when we're getting a lot more water, as opposed to during, uh, the summer when, uh, we tend to be a little bit more dry, and when we are using a lot of irrigation for, uh, production purposes, we would also only need to use it for a couple of days each year, right? So you might be using a ton of water while you're frost protecting, but you're not frost protecting very frequently. And really, folks try not to, not to frost protect if they can help it at all. So it seemed like a very reasonable step for us to look at some new or modified permitting options from the Florida aquifer in the suspension area. So as we started to develop the program, we wanted to solicit some very specific feedback. Uh, we wanted to hear from everyone broadly, but we also wanted to hear from some targeted stakeholder groups, and I have them listed here. I wanted to highlight a couple, uh, Georgia Farm Bureau who they're hosting us today. They were, uh, a member of that targeted stakeholder group. We also reached out to all Georgia State Senators and Georgia House of Representatives, uh, members who had any portion of the suspension area within their district. We wanted to make sure, uh, that the legislature was well-informed of our activities. We also reached out to the chairman of the Senate and House Ag Committees. Uh, and there were a number of other, uh, organizations that we reached out to as well, to make sure that we were capturing all of the feedback that we could from the farmers. We also wanted to get out there and meet folks where they were. So we went to a couple of different meetings. We went to the Upper Flint Regional Water Planning Council meeting in Reynolds. We went to the Lower Flint Regional Water Planning Council meeting in Camilla to talk about this and solicit feedback from the council members and anyone else who was able to attend. And we also held our own stakeholder meeting on June 21st down in Albany. A number of folks were here in the audience and at the table were able to attend. And we really appreciate that attendance and that participation. At that meeting, uh, E P D was invited to go out to a farm, which was a very, very good idea. It allowed us to go out and see how the actual irrigation systems were set up. So in July, we went and saw a citrus farm, saw how the irrigation system worked, how it was set up, how it was used for frost protection. We also went to a blueberry farm. Those are the two biggest commodity groups where there's interest in frost protection. And based on that, as well as the 27 substantive comments that we received from 13 commenters, we were able to make some updates in how we proposed to do frost protection permitting here in the state. Thanks to these updates, we feel like we're in a really good position to initiate frost protection permitting for the suspension area starting on September 1st. So we'll start accepting new and modified applications at that point. Now I wanna highlight a couple of things about this permitting framework. You'll, you'll notice black text and red text. Uh, the black text is what was original from E P D when we sort of set up how the permitting would look. The red are modifications that we made in response to comments, conversations, site visits, things like that. So first, we're looking just at Florida and aquifer water withdrawals. We're not contemplating any new or modified withdrawals from surface waters. We feel comfortable that we can do this in the Florida and aquifer, particularly in the green zone, whereas less of that hydraulic connectivity. But we received some very good comments that perhaps the areas of need where citrus farmers and blueberry farmers really need to be, may be in the red and yellow zone. While we don't feel comfortable opening up the red and yellow zone without having more data. So what we're gonna ask is that folks give us letters of interest. This will give us information like a permit application, allow us to put it into the model, and we'll be able to see what kind of capacity we have. That way, if there's interest in ye in yellow or red zone frost protection permitting, we have good data, good science, a good technical response in terms of whether anything is possible, what might be possible, and what we could do next. The other thing was that we really wanted to highlight the Florida and aquifer as the source. Uh, so surface water would not be contemplated all, and folks asked for a lot of clarification because there's some parts of, uh, sub area four, where the Florida aquifer just isn't quite as productive. So if we were only pulling from the Florida aquifer, it might not be enough to really protect the plants during a freeze event. However, if you had a welt upon system, you could store a lot of water in that pond and it could then be applied kind of a way to make a less productive, well really meet what you need. We acknowledged that there was a lot of benefit there. You still wouldn't be taking anything outta the Flint River. Its tributaries. You'd still be protective of those flows, but you would be able to be responsive to the fact that there are hydro, um, how would they put it? Hydrogeologic challenges, uh, in that portion of the basin. Next, anyone can apply for permits regardless of whether or not you have an existing permit with e P D. Um, but we will, uh, need to require telemetry. So this was a point where we had a lot of discussion. Uh, telemetry is a way for us to get, uh, high quality, quick data on how water is being used. This is not intended for E P D to be, to come in and make decisions about how the farm is operated. It is really just for us to be able to have that kind of compliance data and that kind of usage data. That is really critical for us in terms of being able to defend the program. Also, really critical for us in terms of being able to model and identify where there might be additional capacity, what we might be able to do next. But because we're looking at, because we are requiring telemetry, it means that we can be a little bit more flexible in another area. Initially, we had said that we were going to just have production wells and frost protection permitting wells. We'd have to keep them totally separate, that we wouldn't look at variable rate motors, that we wouldn't look at any of this kind of stuff, that we really wanna be certain that we were having compliance 'cause production and frost protection would be kept separate. Farmers showed us that that was a bad idea very quickly. That was a way of increasing cost without getting any real benefit. And they were exactly right. It would require two irrigation systems, two wells, two, everything doubling the cost, making it much harder for the farmer to recoup their investment. Um, and with the telemetry, we would actually be able to get all of the compliance data that we needed, uh, without any concerns about where that might end up going. So we felt that we were able to now with telemetry, make this shift to allow one well to be used for, for production and for frost protection, uh, allowing just that one irrigation system, allowing the use of variable rate motors. All of that, um, we felt was allowable, defensible and fully acceptable. So as we're going through this process, we're gonna continue to identify what we can do next within the basin, how we may be able to look at the suspension, where we might be able to identify new options for permitting. But we need to do that in kind of a comprehensive way. And the best way for us to do that is through something called a habitat conservation plan. This is actually part of that ARPA project. A habitat conservation plan is part of an incidental take permit that you have with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service. This is critical if you are dealing with endangered species, which we are in the Flint Basin. We have, um, four endangered species, one threatened species. And just this past June, another species of mussels was being proposed for listing as endangered in the basin. So to keep us in a position where you have some regulatory certainty, where we're able to protect existing users and make good long-term management decisions, we can work together on developing this habitat conservation plan, which will sort of spout all the different things we can do on the water quality side, on the water quantity side to protect the mussels, both kind of that final goal of protecting ag and ag water withdrawal here in southwest Georgia. So, with that, if there are any questions, I think that Jim, and I'll be very happy to answer them. Alright, thank you very much. Uh, first I'm gonna apologize to our appropriations chairman for not seeing his, uh, question, uh, while ago. I apologize, Mr. Chairman, uh, chairman Perkel, I think Mr. Chairman, do you want the question to be for the water or for the other? You got how many questions?

        text: "Or either you do you want to do first round two afterwards. Uh, they're both exceedingly important to such Proceed on Mr. Chairman. I prefer my time. Thank you. Proceed on. So, so regarding water, and I, I, I do thank you for, um, steps to, um, uh, to lift some of the restrictions, um, for water withdrawal. Um, I, I think of all the steps we could have done, um, the one that impacts fewer farmers, uh, in the state of Georgia is what we chose. Uh, I would say less than 1%, uh, for, you know, blueberry citrus farmers for frost protection to use once a year, perhaps once a year. Um, so my friends in the red zone, uh, in the yellow zone, uh, that are trying to feed and clothe the world are As mad as a wet setting hand that we've, that, um, they, they have been, um, trying to operate with not just one hand, but both hands tied behind their back, uh, to, uh, feed and clothe the world. And I would like to see us take, uh, additional steps beyond, you know, thank you for what we've done, but that is, that impacts the least number of farmers I can imagine. That we could, that we could do, um, in the state. Uh, additional steps, and, and I know you want more data, but we've been looking at it since for 10 years. Surely we got the data that we can use to support, uh, additional, uh, steps. One of which, just off the top of my head, when we first put the Mortor moratorium in place, uh, we used a blanket across this area. Perhaps my farm, perhaps my neighbor's farm does not, you know, the surface runoff doesn't go to the flint. Maybe this one goes to the Swanee, or maybe it goes to the, um, one of the other tributaries. But it, it, it is not impacted. But because I'm in the red zone, uh, I cannot irrigate out of the pond that I built on my farm in order to, in times of a drought, I swear I'm not touching it. Uh, but in times of a drought, um, to what are my peanuts or my cotton, uh, and not just about in February and March for blueberries one time a year. Yes, sir. You're exactly right. This is absolutely a first step, and this is a first step that we felt really comfortable taking right now, because we do think that the impact on the water resource will be so low, but the intent is to have something that is much more comprehensive and much broader and looks at the entire basin, that we're not just stuck in this one area. So the Habitat conservation plan is really kinda the framework in which we're working in on that. The goal is to have that completely done in Fish and Wildlife by the end of 2024. And we anticipate that in the next, uh, I don't even know, number of months, but definitely as we're going into 2024, we're gonna be having a lot of dialogue with folks down in the basin on what can we do next? We're gonna have to talk about different options for permitting. It will not be just limited to looking at the green zone, but we need to have, I think we need to have a lot of conversation. We are not, we have a lot of data, but the way that you use the data depends on the questions that you're asking. And I think that for a long time we've been asking your own questions. Um, but we also need to tier from the stakeholders. So, and I would like, uh, to follow up, Mr. Chairman. So, uh, I would suggest that, uh, you know, instead of holding a, a regional meeting, so if you went to like, uh, each county in the affected area mm-hmm. Always the extension does a great job. Um, has a, um, a, a cotton production meeting, a peanut production meeting, a corn production meeting, they all show up at, because these are areas where we find new ways that I can grow a crop mm-hmm. More efficiently, uh, have better yields. And they're all there. And I can tell you what they're gonna say about this dgu muscle that you found for this wildlife thing. Uh, because it is directly impacting our ability to feed and clothe the world. And it's a resource that we can't utilize, particularly in the red and and yellow areas. It is, if you really want feedback, if you go to these meetings, I'm telling you, them boys will not hold black. Uh, they will, they will absolutely let you know what they think about the muscle. I've been very fortunate to be able to go down to southwest Georgia pretty much every other week for the last three or four months. I will go anywhere within the basin that I'm invited. So I'll be happy to talk to any of those groups if you can help facilitate that connection. Absolutely. I'll be very happy to, to go. Thank you. Talk to folks. Thank you. How about solar? Can I do one or have I coming up? Go ahead, roll. So, um, I have a problem with these big facilities being called solar farms, and I think, um, a solar facility, because it's not a farm, one of the concerns I have, you have a lot of, um, permitting for these now. Uh, so you look at where, uh, the drainage is, uh, where the, um, where all this water's gonna go. It's gonna come off the top of these solar panels and these facilities, these large facilities. One of the concerns that I have, and I don't know if you can make it part of, of your permitting process. So there are, uh, ag lands in the state of Georgia ain't worth it, toot. There's a different, um, quality of soils. Some of 'em, I'm telling you, the, you, you can't, the world together, it's easier. That's right. They're just holding the world together. You, you could grow a cotton crop on this carpet here easier, and you can, in some of the soils, it's really sandy. That's, that's, that's not much good. But in some of the pictures you have, we're taking good productive agricultural land, and you're not doing it. But somebody is. When you throw enough money at this process, then we're taking some of our more productive agricultural lands in some of the areas that some of these men and women represent. They're taking pivots down, uh, of exceedingly quality ag lands and putting up these solar facilities. Um, and I know part it's driven by the money. Uh, some of our high tech companies in the urban areas, uh, want green power. And so they'll contract with somebody in South Georgia to take ag, productive ag lands and put it in these solar facilities so that they can say, you know, we've got, so much of our power is generated from quote unquote renewable resources. In effect, all we're doing is taking a economic engine, the one that we have in rural areas, and transferring it to the urban areas. Um, I don't know if in your permitting process, uh, one of the things in addition, looking the wetlands around it, making sure that, uh, the, the, um, uh, the water that's gonna flow off these panels, it doesn't, um, uh, cause problems in our, in our rivers and strains. But also, what are you taking this from? Is it, uh, a top quality of soil, uh, or is it a lower quality, um, ag land? Um, but every time we're taking ag lands out of production, God is not putting a similar amount of ag lands into production. And for rural communities, uh, farmlands is a vital resource that we have, and it's being taken from us. And I know part of it is through the whatever reduction act and it's money that's thrown out, but, uh, this ag lands, we will never get back. So Yes, sir. Um, and unfortunately, there's, as far as our, our N P D S permit goes, we can't really regulate, um, what, what somebody does with their land as long as it's within the confines of the law. It's more of how they develop that land, uh, in a responsible manner as it pertains to erosion, sedimentation control. Uh, but we run into this a lot with different, not only solar, but different industries of you need to tell 'em they can't put this there. That's, that's up to local zoning ordinances, uh, in the local government on, on particularly like what they can put on their lands. Is it? But if, if you can tell them, you can't put this solar facility here because it has too much slope, or it flows into this stream, can you not also say, you can't put it here because this is this type of a soil, this is a productive axle. Yeah. That's not part of the, so, So part of our permit, we, we evaluate those things. It's not necessarily, you can't put it there, but you may not necessarily be able to disturb as much acreage at one time. You would be more limited based on the topography and the soil type. Um, but the, the additional b and p guidance document that are referred to, or the larger stakeholder group, that's one of the things that's addressed in there. Uh,",

        text: "there's a solar siding tool that's provided. There's also, um, uh, recommendations on particularly looking at, uh, less sought after sites for other things. For example, like a surface mines that could be reclaimed, uh, brownfield sites. And, and also one of the things that's mentioned in there is that you should identify and make sure that those are not highly productive. That, and I can't remember this term that's, that's used in there, uh, but make sure that there's not highly productive ag soils on that site because we recognize that there are sites, um, throughout the state that are a lot more product, that have a lot better and more productive soils than others. Um, does that answer your question a little bit? Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you. We've got a couple more people that want to ask questions. Uh, chair, recognize, uh, representative Al Williams. Thank you. Um, Dr. Anna, I think you know this one's for you. I forgive me, but your last name's not too familiar down in Midway, but if you'll let me call you Dr. Anna, and to my friend, representative Perkel, if you think they talk stuff about that muscle, you should have heard what was said about that woodpecker that stopped us from tank trails at Fort Stewart. But would you, would you address my water question? Why can't we get some relief? And right next door to us, of course, is a green county, and we just need a little bit of water. And the good Lord put a lot of it on the Floridian, and why can't we get some? So this is in reference to the, um, permitting moratorium that's put in place in southeast Georgia, also on the Florida aquifer. Basically, the level of water withdrawal, especially around the city of Savannah, was such that we were starting to see saltwater intrusion coming into the Florida aquifer around Hilton Head Island and moving toward the city of Savannah. Mm-hmm. And so there've been a number of initiatives over the last decade or two, I mean longer than that, but particularly in the last decade or two, that is focused on trying to reduce the speed with which salt water is kind of moving into that Florida and aquifer. And so I think that where we're at is we're at a point now where we need to start having some more conversations about what water management is going to look like there. Mm-hmm. We are at a point where we've got the megasite coming in that's gonna be using quite a bit of water. It's pulling from the Green Zone in Bullock County. And in that evaluation, we did look at what would those withdrawals look like on Hilton Head and Saltwater Intrusion. Um, there's some discussion of regionalization and using, uh, surface water from the Savannah to help support, uh, growth that's gonna be in these areas. Um, but then there's also a lot of discussion of, can we take another look at the red and yellow zone because we've making these reductions, we're seeing some improvements. Mm-hmm. So E P D is hosting a meeting with the Coastal Regional Water Planning Council. This is, uh, a group of, um, people who have been appointed by the governor, Lieutenant Governor speaker of the house that, uh, review and make water plans for large regions. Uh, we just updated the plan in June of this past year. There's gonna be a council meeting in September that's gonna talk about sort of a data summary, what we've done, where we've, where, where we were, what we've done, where we are now, and we've been discussing that we need to support that with some additional stakeholder work. Um, starting to talk to folks, especially as we're getting close to 2025. Right. Because the first round of conversations was, what are we doing as we move to 2025? We're getting close to 2025 and there's no, no, what's next? So it's less fleshed out in terms of where we're going next than Southwest Georgia, but it's a conversation we have to initiate because we recognize that there are some real consequences for the people who live and work in those areas. Quick follow up. Yes, sir. Keep in mind when you take another look at it, that we, we don't clo we don't clothe the world, but our impact be a little greater than some blueberries down in my friend's area. So, but we are desperately in need of some help, and it's time to take another look when the Corps with the Supreme Court's decision. Hopefully the interpretation will prove to be as helpful to the area as we expect it to be in relation to, uh, wetlands. Mm-hmm. What, those are desperate questions in my area, water and wetlands. So the definition of, uh, waters of the US and the protections for the wetlands will not have any effect in terms of how we're looking at groundwater at this point. It also does not have really any effect in terms of how E P D is regulating the wetlands definition was for federal permits, particularly federal 4 0 4 permits. All we do with, uh, in relation to that is issue 4 0 1 water quality certificates to make sure that whatever activity is happening that the 4 0 4 permit is allowing doesn't hurt our water quality. So we may end up seeing fewer of those 4 0 1 water quality certs come in, but we're not anticipating at this point any sort of change in our process, um, related to those, um, federal rule changes. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. We're running a little bit behind time. We're gonna recognize, uh, representative Darlene Taylor and then Chairman Jaspers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I feel your pain representative. Um, Williams, we had a problem with that woodpecker down in South Georgia. It took us 10 years, but we got a road and that's what counted. And today as they're evacuating Florida, we need that four lane. So, so, but my question really had to do with the solar panels. Um, I have been concerned about the runoff and the water runoff and how it is affecting it. So it sounds like you've got some things you're looking at more closely now before they're permitted. The second part of that has to do with, um, the dispose of it. We know this equipment and what it's made of is not gonna last forever. Do you have something in the permitting process that they have to have a plan where they're gonna go, what they're gonna do with it when it is no longer any good? And second, do we need to set up a fund or something to make sure there's gonna be some way to clean up this mess? Thank you. So to answer the first part of your question, the, the simple answer is no. It's a construction permit. So it's basically just for the construction of the site. It's not for the, it's not a permitting process for the overall permitting of, of the, the solar farm or the solar facility. Um, Do we need to have better control? Do we need to do something more that I don't know if, if Georgia Power and or the local EMCs or the Public Service Commission have anything to do with that? Um, but if they don't, that may be something to look at because we have rules and regulations on making sure that the, the things are properly disposed of at a properly permitted facility. But unless they want to be a permitted, solid waste disposal facility, and they wouldn't fall under our solid waste regulations other than properly disposing of the material. Does that make sense? Yeah. I think it's something we need to look at, though. I think it should be part of the process. When you're building something, there has to be a complete project, and we know these materials don't last forever. Whatcha gonna do with it afterwards. I don't wanna be stuck with batteries like we have and other issues. So I think that might be something this we need to look at. Thank you. Thank You Chairman. Jaspers, I'd be real quick. This is for James also, you know, for a layman who looks at all the M P D S permits, has never learned and talked one, and I will congratulate, I thank y'all for what we heard last year to where we're at today. But just in simple terms, are we, you look at what you've done with a solar facility site versus a a, a regular industrial site or a housing site. Are the regulations you've put in, are they weaker or stronger or equal to what you're doing for, for them? Uh, they're, they're, they're equal. They're some of the provisions we put on them, and that's not, and we've been having internal conversations. Some of the, the stuff that I'm sharing with you is still kind of a draft. We're still working through it, but we're looking at more of it being across the board for these larger scale projects because we're starting to see bigger developments in Georgia. Um, and oh, before the last few years, and most of the sites that we've dealt with, I've, I've been doing this for 20 years, never got over two or 300 acres. Uh, and we're seeing quite a significant uptick in sites that are 5, 6, 7. I mean, there's some right now that I've seen that are coming. They're up up to 13,000 acres. Well, I guess to follow up again, Mr. Chairman, why are they not treated as an industrial site, just like the Hyundai site on 16 or wherever, that they have to meet those same criteria for water runoff and retention of soil on that side. So is there an s i c code for solar farms? So solar farms are not, or solar facilities are not considered a, uh, industrial process the way that, uh, e p a designated industrial processes for management of their runoff. So what we're talking about here is just for construction, stormwater, and in terms of construction, stormwater, all sites as they're being constructed, are treated the same way. So there're gonna be differences based, as Jim said, on uh, location. They're gonna be some site specific things, but ultimately what we're doing on the construction stormwater side is making sure we're not sedimenting in our streams and rivers once the facility is built, depending on what is happening at that facility, depending on the layout, depending on all of that kind of stuff, there may be other nip d permits necessary. So for the Hyundai mega site, right, they're going to have a pre-treatment permit to send their wastewater, I think initially to city of Savannah and then to Bryan County. And then there's also, uh, potentially industrial stormwater permit to deal with the industrial stormwater runoff that comes out, um, for solar. There are some post-construction best practices, but it really is about that vegetation and trying to reduce the amount of runoff coming on. I dunno if you had anything else to add on the Yeah, Yeah, I was just making sure she's a little more familiar with the industrial side than I am. I wanted to make sure they didn't have an SS i c code that would make them get Well, it just seems like if coverage,",

Thank you. Um, for, uh, obviously the Rural Development Council and the work that you have done in, in my experience in the legislature, obviously being on the other side of the Capitol, never participated in the Rural Development Council, but I can tell you as a member, former member of the Senate Body, the work that this council has done and, and the legislation that's come out of this particular body, I think is, uh, has done great work and great strides for rural Georgia. And, uh, I commend all of you and Speaker Burns for continuing, uh, the work of the R D C, um, because I think it's vital and important for rural Georgia. And as many of you know, agriculture is the backbone of rural Georgia. Uh, without agriculture, rural Georgia would not be able to, uh, to sustain. And I would argue all of Georgia wouldn't be able to sustain. Uh, it's our number one industry. It's, uh, the backbone of what we do. It's what we do well in this state. Uh, and I am honored and proud to serve alongside of y'all as the 17th Commissioner of Agriculture for this great state. So thank you for giving me this opportunity to serve alongside of you. And I can't, uh, tell you how much I appreciate all of you, uh, our work together so far, and even this past session, uh, the work we've done together. Thank you for, uh, that support. Uh, many of you helped us in a lot of different, uh, ways. Chairman Houston, chairman Hatchett, uh, chairman Perkel, I'm gonna start naming names. I'm gonna get in trouble, but y'all, y'all, a a lot of you Chairman Smith went above and beyond in a lot of different capacities to help us address the needs we had at the department, uh, initially. And, and obviously we have others. And, and we're gonna talk about some of those, uh, today. But as many of you know, as I, I, I discussed, uh, the role of this council is, is vital to the success of rural Georgia and, uh, and our number one industry. And for the number one industry to continue to be successful. The department that oversees that industry has got to be successful as well. Uh, and that's the reason I think the Department of Agriculture and the role it plays in the lives of every Georgian, every day. I tell people as I travel this state, the Department of Agriculture impacts every Georgian every day. There's hardly a day. There's really no day that goes by that every Georgian impacted in some way by our agency. Whether it's a mill or a gas station, or a grocery store, or, uh, or pest control, you name it, uh, we do it. Um, but at the same time, you know, farmers are asked to do less with more. Uh, our state of the ag industry and our state I think is strong even though, uh, chairman Dickey and a lot of our peach growers had a pretty tough go earlier this year with about 90% crop loss, uh, which is very significant, uh, to, uh, to our state. And, uh, and, and that's one of those things that, you know, we've gotta continue, uh, to fight for. It's important what we do in agriculture, but we've gotta continue to allow that that playing field to be level for agriculture, to continue to succeed. And, uh, and we're willing to be a part of that to help address those headwinds in the industry, uh, to ensure that we're bridging that farm to fork divide, and putting more of that retail dollar back to the family farm where, uh, where it, where it needs to be. Uh, because those rural communities are vital to the success, uh, of our state. Uh, and I know y'all have heard a lot of presentations this morning. The Ag Water conversation is, is vital. Uh, and, and I appreciate the work that our friends at E P D are doing. Uh, and I, and I like, I look forward to our continued partnerships together, uh, moving forward. Uh, just really quick, uh, just to kind of give you a, a, uh, for those of you that were in Perry the other day at the Ag Issue Summit, some of this is gonna sound familiar, uh, but just really briefly, just kind of a quick departmental update, uh, on where we are. Uh, so for those of you that don't know, the Georgia Department of Agriculture was the first Department of Agriculture in the nation. Uh, we're number one and we're proud of it. So the Department of Ag was established in 1874. So next year, uh, quick math for those of you that are math whizzes, uh, is 150 years. Uh, so we're gonna celebrate 150 years of Georgia agriculture, 150 years of the department. We're already working on some of that as an agency just to kind of tell that story. It gives us an opportunity to use something to tell the story of Georgia Agriculture. And we're really excited about that, uh, to talk about the many different divisions and over 70 licenses that we issue, uh, from animal health to the state vet to, uh, pest control and everything in between. And, and letting folks know that we're involved in ways that they don't even know. You know, for those of you that don't know, we, we weigh all the power balls before the Georgia Lottery, uh, rolls out what the numbers are. Uh, you know, and that's, uh, and Reverend Williams, we have nothing to do with what numbers hit though. I apologize. Alright. Uh, but I'd be happy to show you the scale where we weigh 'em at. Uh, so, uh, we, we, we make sure that it's fair, right? Uh, so, uh, I, I think if we had any of that knowledge, I wouldn't have any employees at the department 'cause they'd be winning it all the time. Uh, but no, we, you know, there's ways that we're involved and folks don't even know. And, and, and obviously the Georgia Grown program's been phenomenal and, and getting that message across. And we look forward to, uh, to building that. We also look forward to the national Georgia National Fair that's coming up. And we're looking forward to, uh, the little bit of, uh, of, uh, friendly competition that's gonna be happening, uh, at the fair between the House and the Senate at the Legislative Livestock Showdown. So, if y'all have never been to that, I encourage you to come, because that's gonna be exciting, uh, as always. And we're, we're, we're really looking forward to that. But, uh, we're, we're making a few organizational changes and, and our team has hit the ground running. And, uh, some of them are here. Many of you know Jenna Saxon, who's my chief of staff, uh, Dominic's here, who's helping us with our constituent services. Uh, Patrick, uh, Guthrie is here, who is, uh, helps me, uh, in my office and helping us stay straight. And many of you know Katherine Russell, who does our policy work. So, uh, those are kind of the folks to reach out to as far as our agency is concerned. Just kind of diving off into it, uh, we've had this little, uh, this little insect pop up, uh, recently, uh, that we have found here in the state of Georgia, the yellow legged Hornet. Um, just wanted to give you an update since I visited the, uh, the, uh, the Ag Issue Summit last week. We've had a few more updates. Um, as many of you know, we found this, uh, earlier. This, this month was confirmed at the beginning of August. Uh, it was the first con confirmation of this hornet in the United States, uh, found in the wild, uh, ever. Uh, and, uh, so our team immediately went to work to, uh, to find, trap and eradicate this hornet. It is a ferocious predator of pollinators, specifically honeybees. Uh, so why is this important to Georgia? Why is it important to Georgia Ag? Well, about 400 honeybees contribute about 450 million to the ag economy in our state. Watermelons, blueberries, uh, and, and other crops, uh, over a hundred different crops are actually pollinated in, in,",

        text: "in the United States. Uh, so you need these pollinators for agriculture to be successful. And so if they're taking out the pollinators, that means it's a lot harder, uh, for us to grow those crops in our state. Uh, so we went to work, um, we, uh, actually found a nest, uh, on, uh, August 18th. Uh, and our team began to make plans to get rid of that nest. Uh, a little over a few days later on August, uh, 23rd, uh, we did a night operation. Uh, so, uh, so our team went to work at night, and, uh, we, uh, used, uh, an insecticide, um, and, uh, to, uh, neutralize the nest and neutralize the adult hornets. Uh, and we had a tree surgeon climb up 85 feet in the tree where the hornet's nest was located. Uh, and they, uh, they sawed it out. Uh, and, uh, we have some pictures of that that you can see. I, I don't have any on here, unfortunately. But, uh, that nest was huge. It was about this big around. And, uh, the, what I understand, it stood about Taw. Uh, it was, it was the, as the entomologist from the University of Georgia said, it was the largest nest he had ever seen. Uh, and, uh, so, um, he, uh, it's been a, it's been an interesting ordeal. So that is the first nest confirmed in the United States ever. Uh, we took it out. Uh, obviously we're going to continue to respond to any sightings, uh, continue to trap and work to continue to eradicate the yellow legged Hornet, uh, because it is detrimental to Georgia Ag, and we've gotta continue to do that. So, uh, I can promise you our team is working every day to do that. I can't thank Mike Evans and our Plant Protection division enough for the work that they have done and our coordinated efforts with the University of Georgia and with U S D A aphis, uh, and our work together to get to this point. We're, uh, this was a big win, uh, but obviously we're, we're not resting. We're gonna stay vigilant. Uh, and if there are any other nests, we're gonna work to eradicate those as well. Um, moving forward, uh, just kind of diving off into some policy issues, as, as all of you know, hemp, uh, falls under the Department of Agriculture and, and, uh, the work that we do there. However, uh, I just kind of wanted to bring you up to, to ed on some things that some other folks have done in the state of Florida. Our friends across the line down south, uh, did an operation, uh, with their law enforcement unit in the Department of Agriculture, uh, and their hemp, hemp, uh, division. And, uh, they hit 475 stores, found over 70,000 illegal hemp products, uh, in those stores. Uh, and they, they worked to address that, uh, it was called Operation Candy Crush. It was the largest inspection and sweep, uh, of hemp products that I know of. Um, and, uh, and, and the problem is, is these products were specifically targeting underage kids, as you can see, by looking at the packaging. Uh, those are not, uh, that's not sour patches. Those are stoner patches, as it says on the label. Um, and, and, and, and, uh, you know, that's the issue that we have found, and we see, and we're dealing with this in the state of Georgia. The issue is, is we do not have the same authorities as the Department of Agriculture does in the state of Florida, uh, to do what they did. Uh, we, uh, we are, uh, restricted in some capacities to be able to address that. Uh, chairman Perl had a bill this past session that y'all passed out of the house. We had a little hiccup over in the Senate, uh, that would've helped address, uh, some of these issues. Uh, so I just want to bring this up and encourage you. Uh, we're really interested in helping address this addressing the under 21 issue, addressing what's legal in our state, what's not. Uh, and we're ready to go to work. Our team is ready to go to work. We just have to have the tools, uh, to do that. We've been doing some secret, uh, shopping ourself, um, across the state. Uh, we have found hemp products being sold in our state with as high as 24% t h c. To put that in perspective, the legal limit for hemp is 0.3%. So they are 23.7% higher than the legal limit. Um, and, uh, and so we know it's illegally being sold in our state. We know that these are issues we have in our state. We're willing to work with our state and federal partners to address it. Uh, we're just looking to you to help us get the tools we need to help ensure that this can be addressed. Now, we want the hemp industry to be successful, and I do believe the hemp industry in the state of Georgia can be successful. But as long as we have, uh, basically an open door policy when it comes to this, and people feel like they can come to the state and just go free nilly, so to speak, in this industry, uh, it doesn't allow the, the, the, the, the true industry to be successful. It doesn't allow them to get off the ground. Uh, it makes no sense to grow hemp in the state of Georgia when you're bringing it in from Colorado and California and other states, uh, when it isn't being addressed in that capacity. So, we have the ability to have a thriving hemp industry. Uh, we just have to address the illegal side of it to ensure that that happens. As many of you know, we, uh, are in the electrical vehicle charging business now as the, uh, department of Ag, and we look forward to, uh, to taking that on. It doesn't go into effect till, uh, 2025. Um, but obviously we'll be discussing the funding needs and the resources we need as an agency, uh, to put this in motion, uh, just for, so, you know, in full disclosure, uh, the testing units that we've been looking at have tripled in price just since session ended. Uh, so that kind of gives you an idea. So some of the numbers we were talking about back during session, obviously, those, uh, are no longer valid, unfortunately. Um, but that kind of gives you an idea of, of what we've been, we've been keeping our pulses on it and keeping an eye on it, but we're, we're ready to go to work. Uh, we just wanna make sure that you're aware of the needs we have to ensure that we're able to address this and ensure that this industry is able to thrive in our state, uh, and we look forward to playing our part, uh, in that as an agency. Um, raw milk is also something that's, uh, just hit the ground. Uh, it started, obviously on July 1st. Uh, our agency has been up and going and, and running and, and ensuring that this gets off the ground and gets going, uh, smoothly. Uh, we have been held, we have held interest sessions all around the state. Uh, we've had a number of people that are interested in this program. Uh, many producers that showed up and showed interest and, and some of which are applying to be licensed. So we're working through that process. Uh, right now, we're only about eight weeks, obviously, into the program. Uh, so we're working through that. I just kind of wanted to give you a brief update on where we are on the new programs that are, that are getting going. So that's, that's where that is. And we're gonna continue to work through that to ensure, uh, that raw milk and that program is, uh, is successful. Um, a big issue as I travel the state and talk with farmers and producers, obviously there's a lot on a lot of people's line, but, uh, foreign ownership of land, especially by countries that are adversarial to the United States, is an issue. About 4% of land in the state of Georgia is owned by foreign entities. Uh, and, and look, it's, this is a balancing act. Uh, we know that there are nations that are, that are very friendly to our state. Uh, but we also know that there, there are those that are not friendly, uh, to, to the United States, uh, or to our state. As many of you know, food safety, food security, and agriculture is national security. And if we wanna really take, uh, this serious, we've gotta take on, uh, issues that impact our ability to allow us to continue to be successful, uh, and our number one industry to be successful. And part of that is ensuring that, uh, we protect our ag land, uh, for the purposes of production agriculture, uh, and especially from, from those who may be adversarial, that may wanna, uh, to, to, uh, to grow crops for specific purposes, may not, they have no interest in ensuring that America is able to feed itself, or that us in Georgia have a successful ag industry. Uh, so I think it's important that we, uh, work to address this. I know Chairman Perl has a piece of legislation we've been helping and working with him on, and we look forward to continuing those conversations to help ensure that we protect our number one industry. Uh, just to bring you up to speed, just so you know, there is some federal action that's happening. Uh, they're looking to put some provisions in the N D A A, the National Defense Authorization Act. They're also looking at possibly putting some provisions in the Farm Bill. Um, so the Feds are looking at this as well. Um, but I think, uh, a state level, uh, action is also something we should be taking on and taken very seriously. Couple other policy issues really quick. Uh, the conservation easement bill that y'all, thank you for passing that. Senate Bill two 20, uh, given us the ability to protect AG Lands in perpetuity for the purpose of production agriculture. I think that's a huge win for agriculture and allowing us to allow this industry to be successful. We're currently working on the rules and appointing that, uh, that particular council, and we're working through that as we speak. And we'll continue to provide you updates on that. All of, you know, the Citrus Commission is often going to, actually, today, the Citrus Commodity Commission is having their first meeting as we speak, uh, which I think is awesome. That commission is appointed, and they're in the, they're meeting right now, obviously, to select their chairman and, and, uh, how they're gonna operate going forward. We're really excited about the citrus industry. And, and lastly, sole amendments. Um, when I took office, this was one of those issues that was, uh, that was very, uh, important. Uh, it was one of those things that was, uh, had a lot of public attention, uh, thanks to many of you. Uh, we were able to get, uh, additional funding in the budget for some additional positions. So, thank you all. Uh, chairman Houseton, uh, chairman Hatchett, thank y'all for helping us ensure that we get those that secured.",

        text: "We're interviewing for those positions next week, hopefully, to have them hitting the ground, uh, very soon. Um, but we did a 90 day review as well, of the program. As I told all of you, we were gonna do that. Uh, we are working on, after that 90 day review, uh, we're, we're working to address some software issues to help with reporting, uh, that I think is, is vastly needed to help us ensure that we're able to more quickly respond. Uh, obviously the, the funding we got from the General Assembly, ensuring that that is appropriated in a way that allows us to continue to, to do our job in that particular arena, uh, and increasing our enforcement and, and inspections related to this particular issue. We've been attending a number of meetings with A C C G. Dominic, uh, specifically has attended a lot of those on my behalf. Uh, we've been having these open conversations with our friends at A C C G to ensure that they understand that this is important. We know it's important, and we're going to continue to find ways to address it. Um, many of you know, and, and I've announced, I, I stood our law enforcement unit at the Department of Agriculture back up, uh, Harlan Prevo, who is a 27 year veteran of law enforcement, uh, across the state from many different capacities. Most recently with, uh, GMA Homeland Security, he was the director of Homeland Security, the, the Deputy Director for Homeland Security at gma. I brought him on board because of his experience in emergency management, but also on the law enforcement side. Uh, but we've hit the ground running. We've been working. Uh, just really quick to speak to the pictures that you see here. Uh, one of the things that I got hit with when I, right, right, right when I walked in the door, was the farmer's market, uh, and the farmer's markets, uh, and the issues that we see there, uh, the crime, the holdups, the snatching grabs. And most recently, about, uh, about two months ago, we had a shooting. Nobody was hurt, but there was gunfire exchanged, uh, on the market in Atlanta. Um, and, uh, and, and, you know, I don't know how many of you may be familiar with the Broken Window Theory, uh, but really quickly, the Broken Window theory is this. If you walk up to two houses, the house on the left has a broken window. The house on the right has no broken windows. Which, which house do you think a criminal is more likely to go into? It's the house with the broken window. So if your, your, your place looks, uh, looks inviting, uh, I would argue the farmer's market looked very inviting. Uh, as you can see from the pictures on the left, uh, there was a lot of, uh, a lot of trash, a lot of disregard for the rules. Uh, and we went to work immediately. I put Harlan and our law enforcement division to work out there. Uh, to my knowledge, we've not had any criminal incidents in the last, uh, month or so. Uh, we've been working to clean it up. The picture on the left is, is right after we took office. The picture on the right, uh, that picture was taken, I guess about, uh, probably about a month and a half ago. You can tell the vast differences in those two pictures. Uh, we've been holding our tenants accountable. Uh, we've been, we've been, uh, holding their feet to the fire. We've been cleaning up the market. So not only have we cleaned it up from a sanitary perspective and food safety perspective, but we've also have, by doing that, we've also helped address the crime issue that we see. Um, furthermore, when it comes to law enforcement, we had got a grant to, uh, fully fund a human trafficking position at the Department of Agriculture to look at help with the human trafficking issue that we have. I know that's a big prerogative of the First Lady. Uh, I know the G B I has a task force. We will be participating with them in that, uh, we're, we're, we're, we're looking forward to working, uh, on that issue. And then, and then when you talk about this, animal abuse is a big issue. Uh, you know, we have a statewide prosecutor now for animal abuse. Our law enforcement division is working really closely with the statewide prosecutor for animal abuse to help address those issues, uh, in our state. Uh, and lastly, drug trafficking. As many of you know, when it comes to, um, when it comes to, uh, criminal activity, it's like water, uh, water flows to the path of least resistance. Uh, unfortunately, we've seen a lot of least resistance when it comes to enforcement related to agriculture. Uh, just recently we found, uh, 40 kilos of cocaine with the, we assisted the d e A and the F B I in an operation, uh, in, in a load of peppers. Uh, you know, those are, those are things that, that cause concern. And for farmers and for the ag community. Why is that important for the ag community? Well, it's important because do you think they care what they sell those peppers for, or bananas, or cabbage or cucumbers? Name the product? Do you think they care what they sell it for? No. All they care about is the fact that they're able to utilize that to traffic their product. And so, why is it important that we're involved in this? It's important because if we stop that, we can ensure that they're not undercutting our producers at the market. Uh, 'cause the folks that are buying those products from those folks, they want, they want more of that because it was cheap. Um, they don't know that it might have been laced with fentanyl, and there could have been that on those cucumbers. We don't know that it's a food safety issue. Obviously, it's a issue overall. Uh, and we're working to address that, and we look forward to having those conversations on how we can continue to do that. Um, we have stood back up with the, with work with, in, in conjunction with D N R and u Ss d a, the feral hog task force. I know y'all heard a lot about deer this morning and crop damage. Uh, so I'm not gonna spend much time on this, uh, other than to say feral hogs and deer, uh, are, are significantly impacting our agricultural crops across the state. Uh, and, uh, we have partnered with D N R and U S D A, like I said, to address this issue. We're hoping that we can continue to get some money, and the Farm bill allow, uh, to allow, uh, to allow this to continue to be successful. We're working with U G A extension to hopefully provide some questions on their next, uh, survey to give us some feedback on exactly the extent of damage that we're seeing in our state. So we can kind of quantify it a little better, uh, to help us better understand that. Um, but we're, uh, we're, we're looking forward to some success from this task force to help us address the crop depredation issue across the state. Um, I will say this, as I said earlier, for the number one industry to be successful, the department that oversees that industry has got to be successful. One of the biggest issues, just to be honest with you that I'm facing at the department is labor is employees. Uh, it's been difficult to keep and hire people. I have 60, currently about 60 funded positions open. I have about 40 of those posted. Seven to eight of those or more have been posted for over a year. And open still most of that, just to be honest, it has to do with salary. We interviewed a, a, a a candidate about two weeks ago for an open veterinary position that we have at the department. We offered in them the job. They called us back and said, thank you. But I've accepted another position with about a 20 to $30,000 increase in salary. And I, I don't blame 'em. I understand that. Uh, but that's the issue that I'm seeing day in and day out across every position that we have. I get a HR report weekly, uh, of the people that we lose. Most of the time, we lose those individuals for no other reason other than better salary or better pay. And in some cases, just to be honest, it's with another state agency. Uh, so we're, we're not necessarily losing folks to industry. We're losing people to my colleagues and other state agencies. And I look, I, Hey, I'm glad we're able to train 'em up, and I'm glad they think our folks are great, but I would like to keep 'em, if you know what I mean. Uh, so, uh, so we're, we're, we look forward to continuing this conversation about how we can address, uh, the salary issue at the department and our needs, and helping us fill those vacancies that we have. 'cause we've gotta be successful. I don't want to tell businesses that they can't open. Uh, and unfortunately, we're having, we've had to have some hard conversations with businesses across this state, because I don't have inspectors to fill that capacity or that role to allow their businesses to expand or be more successful in their communities. And that's something that we don't wanna do as an agency. We want to be an incubator for businesses in our state. And for us to do that, we've gotta be successful. Um, one last thing since this is top of mind, especially with, uh, the news today. Uh, hurricane Alia, as all of you know, and by the way, that is Vidalia without the V So for this South Georgia country, boy, it took me a while to get E Dahlia. I even got it fan phonetically wrote out right here. So I wouldn't say it wrong. 'cause I wanna call it Alia, because that's the way it looks to me. So, if it's okay with y'all, we're gonna call it Hurricane Ilia. Uh, I figured Representative Hagen would be okay with that. Um, I, I agree. Um, so, uh, our team obviously has a part in the emergency management response when it comes to hurricanes. Uh, we have an emergency management arm at the department. Harlan oversees that as well. Uh, we see most of the impacts are gonna happen tomorrow. Uh, obviously we expect the hurricane to be completely out of the state by tomorrow evening. Uh, it is increasing intensity as it enters the Gulf. Uh, the, the, the, if there is a positive to this, the eye of the storm, the center of the storm is small, uh, smaller than what we've seen in other storms, which means the, the, the, uh, the width of impact is a lot, hopefully will be a lot smaller as it, uh, hits landfall. Um, but we can definitely see, uh, 50 plus mile an hour winds, uh, in the impact zone in our state, uh, in the areas closer to southeast Georgia. Obviously, that's the current track that we, uh, that we're looking at. We could see as much as four to six inches of rain, uh, in some places. But obviously, we could see some rainfall in other parts of the state. And I'll be honest with you, in some parts of the state,",

Uh, I know our team is already there. I'm actually leaving here to go there, uh, this afternoon. Uh, but, uh, I know the governor has already issued a state of emergency.

It's vital what you are doing to help our number one industry be successful. Uh, and we've gotta continue to, uh, to work together to make that the case. And I look forward our continued partnerships in making that happen. So thank you for what y'all all do. Uh, I, I think just one other brief thing just to bring to your attention since it happened, uh, just about two hours ago, uh, I heard Otis was brought up a few minutes ago since it was brought up. I'll, I'll give you the latest update. E p a has just issued, uh, a revision, an amendment to the existing modus rule. Uh, they hit that about lunchtime. Uh, my understanding is that particular, uh, issuance went out without comment and without possibility for consideration. Uh, so basically that means for all practical purposes, it's a final rule. Uh, we are evaluating that we so far in our, uh, current, uh, look, it doesn't look very, uh, friendly to agriculture. Um, but we're gonna continue to evaluate that as we move forward. As, as many of you know, uh, attorney General, Chris Carr and I partnered up and, and challenge the, the previous Modus rule. We were successful in the courts. The courts overturned it. Uh, but now we have the new version. Uh, so we're gonna be evaluating that and its impacts on agriculture. But thank y'all for what y'all are doing. Thank you for our partnership together. I look forward to our continued partnerships and serving the state. I look forward to any questions you may have. Mr. Chairman. Thank you, commissioner. We do have some questions. And I would ask the members that do have questions to make sure it is a question. Uh, and, uh, please limit to one question. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chair recognizes representative Darlene Taylor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, commissioner for your report. It is really good. I just had a quick question about how much more your folks are being involved in the security. Um, I'm concerned about their security. Do we have them as certified officers? Are they able to defend themselves? So Our, uh, our law enforcement division are post certified, and they're required to be post certified. Okay. How, how many do we have? Uh, Right now I have, uh, a total of two. Okay. We're gonna get some more, aren't we? But We're, we, we are, we are. We've just, uh, I, I, uh, as I said earlier, we got a grant for a human trafficking position that fully funded that position. Uh, so we, that person should be coming on board next month, so that'd be three. And then we were, we had an open position in the emergency management budget. Uh, and so we shifted that over to law enforcement. And 'cause it's in the same budget. Uh, so we're, we will have a total of four in the next couple of weeks, Just worry about 'em because they're out there sometimes alone. So, and, and I, I'll tell you, our officers actually go out with our inspectors. That's something I think our, our team has realized that there is an advantage. Uh, so when we have hostile environments where our inspectors, uh, sometimes they, unfortunately our inspectors end up in some hostile environments with, with individuals. They have called our, our law enforcement unit, and they have went and met them there and helped them in that particular situation. Uh, so, uh, so we'll be working, hopefully with y'all to help us, uh, uh, increase some additional opportunities and positions in that arena. I think in Florida, they do have inspectors that are armed in It. So Florida has a law enforcement division that is about 150 strong. Okay. Um, I'm just wondering if we need that with so much is needed here. I'm not saying we need 150 officers. I know. Please don't, don't misinterpret that. Uh, But I am concerned about 'em. I have to tell you, I am concerned about them out there. Yes, Ma'am. I, I agree. Thank you. Alright. Now, we are gonna be calling on you as we do our final presentations to the general assembly, and we will be asking you to look at some of our legislation and everything. One more, commissioner. Yes, sir. Did you Have to deploy your entire force to get them those hornets? Yeah. So, uh, Reverend Williams, I thought about calling you and seeing if you wouldn't mind climbing that tree and helping us out. Um, but, uh, but we did deploy a team, uh, and we actually worked with a pest control company, uh, who specializes in, in addressing some of those things. And they helped us out. Uh, but, uh, but we did have a number of our folks there on site, uh, while that was going on. So it was a, it was a, it was a whole operation. So, yes, sir. I'll tell you what, if you want to handle the next one, I'll give you a call. No, no, no. Give 'em a call. Thank you, commissioner. We really appreciate the time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate y'all. God bless you. You'll keep plow. I'll see you soon. Ready, Christopher, We're gonna go on to our next speaker, who is, uh, the Commissioner of Community Affairs Commissioner Christopher Nun. And when Georgia, um, Jenna, assistant Chief's last name. So, good afternoon, uh, everyone, it's, uh, it's a pleasure to be with you. Uh, thank you to Chairman Green and, uh, chairman Jackson for the invitation today. I'm, I'm Christopher Nunn. I'm the Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs. I'm joined today by my colleague, Jenna Webb, who is the director of the one Georgia Authority, uh, as well as two of our colleagues in the back, rusty Haygood, my Deputy commissioner, uh, and Ryan Evans, who heads up External Affairs. Um, what we are pleased to be here today, really just to give you an update, uh, on, uh, the activities of the One Georgia program. Um, I appreciate Leo's help in getting everything teed up. Understand, uh, you may have some, uh, interest in, uh, workforce housing Representative Washburn talked a little bit about that earlier this morning. So plan to cover that. And also, uh, talk a little bit about some of the other rural development programs, uh, that I know are of interest. Um, we'll, we'll try to be, um, where's the quicker? Perfect. Thanks. We'll try to be, uh, get you back on time to the extent we are able. Um, let me just start with a quick introduction before I turn it over to, to Jenna. Um, you know, one, Georgia is funded through appropriations. Uh, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna talk about kind of the process to that point. I'm gonna report back to you on what we do. Um, but I think that the, the fundamental reason that one Georgia exists. Somebody said earlier today, uh, about how important it is that we focus on rural parts of the state. An investment in rural Georgia is an investment in the state as a whole. Uh, and so one, Georgia is really focused on how do we improve the rural parts of our state? And as I give you a bit of a summary, uh, I'll start with a map. The map behind me, uh, is, uh, representative, uh, of those, uh, investments that we have made over just the past five years. Uh, so this doesn't look back over the life of the program, uh, but this is just the last five years of investment, uh, in the state. Uh, and you will notice that there are many I I'll, I'm gonna highlight quickly the fact that, uh, one Georgia has, uh, a couple of, uh, of programs that exist. One of those, the Edge program, uh, is a program that's used to help communities with competitive, uh, recruitment or expansion processes. Those are the blue dots that you see all across the state. Um, the, uh, the equity program, which is the Red Diamonds, uh, that's a capacity building program, uh, that is really important to so many of our rural communities. Uh, we will come in with up to a half a million dollars of investment to help expand, uh, the, the economic development capacity, uh, in, uh, in the community. And then the newest program, which is really still in its, uh, in its infancy. Rural innovation, is, uh, represented by the Green Triangles. Um, you'll notice that there are act, while there's a lot of investment all around the state, there are also some holds in, in this map, which again, is just the last five years. Um, you know, a couple of things that are important to note, communities apply. They engage, uh, and, uh, one Georgia for assistance. Um, we, the Department of Community Affairs, uh, provides technical assistance to those communities. We exist as an agency to help build strong communities across the state. Uh, one of our goals is to strengthen rural Georgia. That's in keeping with Governor Kemp's, uh, objectives. Uh, but companies or, or communities come to us, uh, and engage us in technical assistance. Uh, we review these on a quarterly basis. In fact, we have, uh, a meeting tomorrow. Uh, and probably one of the most misunderstood things, uh, about when Georgia and economic development in our state as a whole, uh, funds are, are awarded on a reimbursement basis to communities. We don't write blank checks to communities. Uh,",

And we thought that it might be helpful just to talk a little bit about some of the success stories, uh, with the program. Uh, and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about housing, and then we'll, uh, we'll entertain questions. Okay. Thank you, Christopher. Um, so I'm gonna talk a little bit about some of our equity program. I, our equity projects we like to highlight that we've done over the, over past couple years across the state. So, as Christopher mentioned, equity is our capacity building program. So these are not necessarily, we've got a project that's landing in your community. It's your community planning for that potential prospect to show up in their community. So it may be helping, um, acquire land for an industrial park, or putting the infrastructure in place in an industrial park so that when a prospect comes to your community, your community is, is ready. So a couple that we wanna highlight is one down in Thomasville. Thomas County, uh, is the Red Hills Business Park. And this one goes all the way back to 2013 when we awarded half a million dollars to assist with water and sewer. From 2013 to 2023, over $17 million of investment has been put in an infrastructure in developing this park out as of just this past couple weeks, um, there's been five major announcements with over 380 jobs and over $88 million of investment in this park. We had a small part in that, but we worked with a local development authority to make that happen. And like I said, that's one of those that sort of is the marathon, right? We've had a couple other quick wins. So about two years ago, Evans County, or a year and a half ago, Evans County came to us, their industrial authority and said, Hey, we need a rail spur in our industrial park. We've realized that we've lost out on several prospects because we didn't have this, and we would like for y'all to assist us. So we came in and awarded them $500,000 to assist with, um, their investment, their local investment, to create this rail spur in their industrial park. Well, within a couple of weeks, they had a locally driven project that announced. So that was a very quick one for us. Um, and as we know that, um, in Stevens County, there's a lot of development up in North Georgia, and they have also been focusing on the industrial piece of theirs. And we've assisted them this, this past year with an equity award for some sanitary sewer, um, improvements into their industrial park. But they've also begun talking about housing in their community. And that's something that Christopher will talk on that they've actually applied for, for our new rural workforce housing, because this is something that their economic development professionals have been focusing on, not just the industrial recruitment piece. Um, as we all know, the Hyundai Meadow plant, you know, has been announced, but with, we have been putting a lot of investment over the several past five or six years into the I 16 corridor. And in Reaven County, we've assisted with helping build a speculative building down there. And that is repaid to the state as a $500,000 loan. And just two weeks ago, I had a meeting with them. They've got someone who's looking to purchase that building to create jobs in that community. Twigs County received some infrastructure money. We've done some things down in Emanuel County a couple of times, but all of these are preparing for that growth that's going to come with the meta plan announcement. So now I'll move on to Edge. As Christopher mentioned, this is what we refer to as our kind of deal closing fund. And this, these are only used, um, as a recommendation by the Department of Economic Development to the Authority Board, and then voted on from there. So these are the ones you kind of see in the news a little bit more. Okay. You don't necessarily see those equity awards in the news as much as you hear these big announcements. But a couple I wanna highlight is the first one is down in Bainbridge. And this is Taurus, um, Taurus Manufacturing located down there. And I'll actually back up a little bit. Years before Taurus decided to come, we assisted them with helping them build a speculative building through equity funds. And because they had that spec building, Tara said, okay, we'll actually come look at your community. So that's what got Tara to walk into the community. They did not locate in that spec building, and they decided to build their own plant. But they've had suppliers that have now located in that spec building. That loan has now been repaid to the state. Um, so if they didn't have that forward thought of thinking and being ready for their capacity, Taurus would've never even looked at them. Um, and then while hers Fara, they, uh, closed their shop infare and there was about a thousand dollars thousand jobs that were lost there. GDA worked with them to market that facility, and they were able to land a Brazilian company that were brought in, brought in 455 jobs there, and $96 million of investment. Um, they've also had several other wins in the region with Regina, uh, lanica, which makes the RAOs pasta sauce in Bacon County. And we've also assisted several times with different expansion efforts in Hazelhurst with Beasley Timber. So there's been a lot of development in that region once that, that large, um, you know, job loss was, was made, we assisted as a state to go in and help create job creation in those rural areas where they were lost. A couple other wins for us have been, um, in Widener, in Widener, um, spring Mountain. They, um, brought in 205 jobs. Ed Morris and Waycross is gonna bring 1400 jobs, and now Workforce housing is going to be an issue for them. I've had several conversations with them surrounding that. Um, and I highlight those in Widener and in Waycross because they also were recipients of equity awards in the past that provided them the, um, the product to be able to provide to these potential prospects. And as Christopher mentioned, this is our, um, less mature and newer program. This one was rolled out in, uh, 2021, late 2021. This is Rural Innovation. We have only gone through eight quarterly cycles for this. We've only awarded seven of the 34 applications that we received. So we're seeing about a 20%, um, approval rating, I guess you would say, on those applications. But a few that I would like to highlight, one is down in Fitzgerald, Ben Hill County, we're assisting with a construction of a commercial and innovative cooperative kitchen. The Development Authority, um, had several local businesses, kind of mom and pop shops that came to them and said, we would like to have a commercial kitchen, but it's way too expensive for us to, to fund that on our own. So the Development Authority started working with these local companies. There's been four that have committed to say they'll come in and they're going to share this commercial kitchen, so then they can take their products to the next level. Um, and the development authority is going to own, and they are going to run that. They're also partnering with their local college and career academy and their culinary arts students. So it's a really good partnership. I'm really excited to get that one off the ground up in Hart County. Um, in response to what their industrial, um, employers have come to them and said, and said, we can't find people to work for us. 'cause they have nowhere to put their children. There's no childcare available. So they listened to that and as a development authority started working with their local industries, and they came to us and said, can you assist us with building a childcare facility that's located in our industrial park? That was very innovative. It was very outside of the box. And we jumped behind this one full force. And we're very excited and hoping that the, that the locals can kind of work out the, the debt side of that piece, because we are doing this in the form of a loan. And the reason why is in case it doesn't get off the ground, the community can still use it as a potential speculative building in their industrial park. So we're trying to see it from both sides of it. They are going to engage with a private, um, facilitator that's gonna come in and run the facility for them. The development authority's not gonna be running the childcare facility, so decals gonna be in there doing that for them. So, um, another exciting was down in St. Mary's. Um, they came together, Camden County and St. Mary's, and they had a blighted, uh, airport in their downtown area. And so they came to us and wanted to repurpose that airport. And so they're turning into an industrial park, and we are assisting with some of the infrastructure and site prep funds for that, uh, is already had about 195 new jobs that have been announced, and about 35 that are gonna be retained through that one. So those have been some really exciting, um, projects that we've done. What we really focus on with rural innovation is we look at as more of our flexible financing tool. So when a project comes to us and doesn't necessarily fit perfectly into one of our, one of our programs molds that we have at D C A, we utilize this rural innovation funding to hopefully come in and assist our communities. So before we talk about housing, uh, let me just, you know, share a couple of, um, of, of thoughts or observations with you. Um, so the pro I mentioned earlier that we have, we engage with communities. Our goal is to help communities to get to, yes. So we engage with professional assistance and technical assistance from day one. Um, but as Jenna laid out, some of these awards are made depending on the eligible use as either grants or loans. And that's based on law, that's based on rule, uh, that's based on other criteria. Um, all of those grants are reimbursement based. I repeat that because I do think that that's a misunderstood concept. And so, from time to time, we'll have communities that are awarded a grant, uh, and immediately are saying, where's our money? Um, now if you have engaged with us upfront, you fully understand the way this is going to work, but I just want all of you to understand that we are stewards of public funds. Uh, for those loans, we underwrite those with a, as a credit team, this would be be no different than a U S D A loan. We understand this is not cream of crop. Uh, otherwise you probably would've gone the community lending route. But we also have to underwrite those to be good stewards of public funds. Um, all of these awards are monitored, uh, in accordance with their performance agreement and any of the Edge awards, those competitive awards, those are subject to clawback provisions. Um, that hopefully doesn't end up in the paper. Um, that, because those are conversations that we have over the course of that loan, uh,",

        text: "and or over the course of that award. And if you're not meeting the expectations that are laid out in a contractual agreement, then we'll have a conversation about that and you can repay the state. Again, we steward these funds wisely. A couple of administrative issues. And I, I think this is fairly consistent with what you have heard from other speakers today. Um, local leadership capacity, uh, is highly correlative with project success. We, as a state, I, I go back to our, our mission at D C A to help build strong communities. We don't come in and do that for you. We, you. So having good local leaders, Dr. Bridge just talked about that, uh, earlier today, that that is vitally important. Engaging dcas technical assistance early. I cannot tell you how many projects go sideways because somebody told me that this is how this is going to work, and they don't engage D C A. That's very important. Um, you're gonna hear from Greg Griffin here in a few minutes. Uh, but delinquent audits and reporting issues are, I, I hesitate to say frequent issues, but are issues that we run across, uh, in terms of a community's eligibility to even receive these awards. And we try to hit that, uh, really quickly and upfront so that people don't waste time. Um, and Jenna mentioned on a couple of occasions as she was talking about capacity building the skin in the game, uh, I'll go all the way back to your first example with the Thomasville Red Hills Business Park. Um, there was a, that required a lot of infrastructure investment. Um, we can come alongside and help and assist with that and some, and, and oftentimes that gap financing is the, is the, the ability to get that project over the line. But we look at what communities, what businesses that may be coming into the community are putting in the game. Now, lemme talk about housing and then we can, uh, we can entertain questions. So, uh, thank you for your support of the Governor's Rural Workforce Housing Initiative. You heard from the outset this morning from, uh, representative Washburn. Probably a lot of the conversations in the margins at the breaks. Uh, housing is a big challenge. It's a challenge for, uh, most every community, uh, uh, that we we talk with around the state. And that looks different in different communities. Uh, it's a challenge for employers. Uh, it's a challenge as we try to, uh, deal with the growth in the state, uh, the Rural Workforce Housing Initiative. Thus, the goal is simple. And that is, how can we help to create more housing for those people who make up the core of our workforce, whether that's low or middle income workforce. And I, I threw some numbers in here just so we can wrap our head around this. This is not codified anywhere, but when you talk about low income housing, we're talking about folks who are making 1525, in some cases, $35 an hour. You know, if you're making less than $50 an hour, you, you're part of the middle income workforce in our state. So I, I think it's important that we can think about that as employers, um, you know, or as, uh, leaders in our communities. So we designed this program with a very flexible approach. Uh, one is to invest, uh, grant funds with communities in infrastructure. Um, that is a significant cost and it flows directly into the cost of the home. Uh, the other is, um, construction lending, low interest construction lending in cooperation with a local bank. Um, so going in, you know, roughly half and half with a, with a local bank to help bring down the, the collective borrowing cost. Um, we launched this program in May, June. Uh, Jenna, I think you did five different workshops. There's an enormous amount of interest in this program because there is an enormous need in the state. Uh, our first round of applications was, were due three weeks after the program was, was announced. We had five initial applications, um, totaling about 10 and a half million dollars in request. Jenna has had ongoing dialogue with more than 20 applicants that plan to come in in the next October round. Um, I look forward to, in the very near future, uh, announcing, uh, the, some of our initial, uh, award recipients pending the, uh, review and approval of the authority. Um, this is a, we believe a, a very important and vital program and one that, uh, you should all be very proud of. And I appreciate your support on that. Um, before I answer questions, I I, I was asked Leo, thank you for, you know, just highlighting, uh, you know, there are a lot of other programs at one Georgia. There are a lot of other programs at D C A that address rural development. Um, just to highlight a few of those. And, and one that I don't think we, we talk about, uh, as much or maybe don't appreciate how it plays into rural development is the housing tax credit. Uh, our housing tax credits, there's a 35% rural set aside, which means at least 35% of those credits are going to rural communities. And let me give you an example. Our executive team, uh, toured the state a few, um, a few weeks ago. We actually spent some time here in Macon. Uh, but we were down in Tifton. Uh, Julie took us around. Mayor Smith took us around, and she took us to an elementary school, uh, just south of downtown. Uh, and right across the street from that elementary school, uh, we using C D B G dollars. We as a state, uh, have invested in a community center that becomes a really vital hub, uh, you know, for the school and for the neighborhood. Adjacent to that community center is a new, a new construction, 80 unit tax credit development that's providing housing for the, for people in the community. I can't tell you where they all work. Some of 'em may work at the Coca-Cola distribution plant. Some of 'em may be in, uh, work for some of you in the, in the ag sector. Some of 'em may work downtown, but 80 homes, uh, adjacent to a community center, well, directly across the street. Representative Houseton is a Tifton public housing development. And they said, you know what? This neighborhood is, this neighborhood is, is on the way up. We need to reinvest, you know, using their own money in their community. So now the housing authority is reinvesting in updating some of their property. Uh, there is a, uh, disused mobile home park that's on 6.7 acres. Immediately next door, they've begun to talk about how might we build single family, you know, development for, you know, at the $150,000, $180,000 price point to sell into this community. Rising tides lift all boats. And the core of that is the housing tax credit, uh, investment. Now, of course, community development block grants. Somebody said earlier, uh, those awards were announced. The annual awards were announced yesterday. Um, that's a very important program, uh, to invest in infrastructure around the state, particularly water and sewer. Um, there are a number of downtown programs, uh, that we, uh, work with communities around the state, be it Main Street, the downtown development, the Rural Zone program, which was actually, uh, passed as a recommendation of the Inaugural Rural Development Council. Um, you know, we have several small business lending programs, uh, including D D R L F, the Downtown Development Revolving Loan Fund, uh, and SS S B C I, the State's Small Business Credit Initiative. Um, but we also have a number of other housing programs. Uh, and one I wanna highlight before I take questions. Um, commissioner Lauro in the back, uh, commissioner Harper who spoke right before me and I, the three of us serve on the, uh, board of advisors for the Georgia Heirs Property Law Center. Um, the reason that that is important is because whether it be forest land, ag, land housing, especially in the rural parts of this state, um, heirs property is a huge issue. We realized this significantly when Hurricane Michael hit South Georgia five years ago this October. Um, in fact, much of the property that has not been rehabbed five years later is because that is, it is tied up in, you know, uh, uh, a very messy title structure. And the Georgia Heirs Property Law Center, uh, is, is working with us, uh, and with others to help address some of those heirs property needs. Um, I'm proud to be, Tyler said the 17th Commissioner. We're a newer agency. I'm proud to be the eighth Commissioner of D C A. I'm proud of the team that we have. I'm proud of the work that we do, uh, and I'm, uh, most appreciative of the support we get from the legislature. So, Mr. Chairman, I'm happy to take any questions, uh, on, uh, anything we do one Georgia related or beyond. Thank you. Thank you Commissioner, for all the work that you do in the state of Georgia. I think we got one question. Uh, chairman Houston, did you have a question? Uh, You mentioned the Georgia heirs, uh, pro, uh, property center. Uh, last year they came and wanted some funding. Are you gonna propose any funding for him and your budget this year? So we've Been working with them. Uh, in fact, uh, commissioner Elmore and I were talking about that earlier.",

        text: "We've been working with them on, on multiple fronts. I know they had that conversation. Yeah, I think that that would be a, uh, I think that would be a, a worthwhile endeavor. I'm still working through all of the needs in our budget and so, so let's have that conversation offline. Uh, Okay. Shortly. The next question. You know, so I, I thought it was so good when somebody was talking about, I guess it was Tallah County and getting 50 employees. So many of these real small counties would just appreciate a small, I mean, 50 in a hundred. We, we can't always have 1500 people working. 'cause we don't have the labor force. I don't know where we're gonna get the labor force for some of 'em we have right now, but, uh, it would mean so much. Is there anything that, that could help us? And we could really focus on small, small family sort of things. I know my, my town in Baren County, it's really, we've got a lot of things going, but it's all local people that have just expanded with, with existing industries, right. And a lot of family things. Right. So I could spend a lot of time delving into that question. Let me hit on maybe three key things. First, you talked about the size of some of these announcements, and Pat Wilson and I have talked, um, you know, if, if you rewind the clock, you know, three years, um, a thousand job prospect was, you know, nearly unheard of. Uh, the examples that Jenna included up here. Um, for example, Taurus, uh, down in, in Bainbridge, that's 300 jobs that include a headquarters of a Brazilian company in Bainbridge, Georgia. Yeah, I was just talking, do you have any little things for little people? So, So, so I think that The little people, So I think that the first thing is recognizing those little Georgia, little Georgia, it's not Brazilians, little Georgia Jones mean. So I think the first thing is recognizing that most of those are not, you know, enormous, but they are, they're significant in rural areas. The second piece is the job tax credit. Uh, Bainbridge Arms though, had another company recently that just had a, I'm Not sure, I think that was maybe 180 or 200 jobs. Yeah, But that was all local. That's right. That was all local. Yeah, That's right. Well, the, the so was the tourists. I mean, the state came in behind the, the locals. I mean, that's the advantage of these one Georgia Investments is we're investing in locally driven economic development so that these communities can go out and market them themselves. Um, but then you ask about kind of let's work our way down. Yeah. Um, the job tax credits are, are important incentives to existing jobs. I know. Okay. And they're very important. That's One reason we've got to look at the job tax credit tier system. You, you, You and I, you had a hearing on that and we talked a lot about it. And I look forward to working with you on that. So that's an important tool. Um, I mentioned the State small business credit initiative that is a lending program, ju companion to the Downtown development. Those are lending programs for small business, and those tend to be downtown operators that might also have taken advantage of the rural zone. And that is something that you and I worked together on in 2017. Mm-hmm. So I think that there are a number of, uh, of programs for all size business. Now, last thing, um, when you think about the 300 jobs mm-hmm. Which is enormous. It really Is for a community of 20,000 people. Right. Um, you have to remember that that represents payroll that is coming into a community. So that also benefits that recirculated payroll that works through your community, that benefits the American in Downtown Bainbridge that benefits the local vet that benefits all of those small businesses in a community. So you do need to think about that trickle down effect. Um, when we talk about the 150 jobs or the 250 jobs, I, I understand what you mean. With a thousand jobs, might as well be, you know, a million, uh, in, in some parts of the state, um, because it is a big number. But, Sorry, I guess I'm lucky. I've got one company that probably has a over a thousand jobs, but everybody's not that lucky. Well, and I, and I'll mention too, with our rural Innovation program, that's why it is considered to be flexible because it's meant to come in and assist with maybe those companies that are expanding, but they're not big enough to get Edge Ariba dollars. And so we've gone in, um, Quitman County, um, they had 15 jobs of Forester Pontoon, and we assisted them with $400,000 through one Georgia. So, and that, it was exciting and that's exciting for Equipment County. It was a huge day. I was there green that day. So it's huge for that community. And that's sort of what one Georgia's supposed to be about. Right. And that's, we encourage, that's back to the beginning of what GE one Georgia was. And that's why we encourage you to engage us quickly and early so that we can provide that pr that yeah. Proper technical assistance to guide you on the right path. We're Gonna, we're gonna have to take two more questions and then we're gonna move on. Chair. Recognize the representative Al Williams. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm particularly interested in the a's property program. Uh, and I'd like to even offline talk with you more. Uh, my district, Liberty County, uh, the reconstruction era forward until the fifties was the largest percentage of African-American farm African-American landowners in America. So we have a disproportionate amount of hes property because people just stepped off the land and didn't probate it. But I'd certainly like to continue that because it is extremely important, especially in hurricane season in getting the help you need. Thank you. I think that'd be a good conversation we can have offline or maybe for a future meeting Chair, recognize the representative, Patty Bentley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, commissioner Non thank you. Commissioner Nunn. I'm sorry. You know, I'm in the funeral business and my phone would ring while I'm getting ready to start talking. It's okay now. But, um, thank you. I just wanna thank you and you and your team for always being available to me to help me with things that I have going on in my district. Um, but my question is relating to when a community is delinquent on their audits, other than being ineligible for funding from D c A, do you have any other suggestions that we may can consider to help ensure that these audits are turned in, in a timely manner? Because it really places the community at a serious disadvantage when a city is five years behind on their audits? Yes. I said five years, and that's in my district. I won't call the name right now, but I'm really upset about that city being five years behind on their audits. And it creates such a major disadvantage for the people of that city. And I don't like it. Uh, I'm glad you don't like it. You're not the only one that has a community that is five years delinquent. And that might be a fantastic segue to your next speaker. I will say that that is an enormous conundrum. We are prohibited by law from funding communities who are delinquent on their audits. Um, and that is for reasons of Financial stewardship of public funds. Um, so it, it is, but, but, you know, someone earlier today talked about, uh, you know, the, the dilemma and the challenge of leadership in, you know, 537 cities and 159 counties across the state. And unfortunately, you'll hear from Greg Griffin, um, we've got a number that are struggling financially as we speak. Um, I don't have a good answer for you, and there's not a federal solution to this either. We, we try to work on, uh, all fronts. We work with our federal colleagues to try to engage them, but nobody's gonna put money into a community that hasn't demonstrated fiscal stewardship. And one thing people have got to remember that so much of, of, uh, Christopher's money is federal money and not state money. And they really have to go strictly by the federal rules and be responsible for this money. That's right. Good point. Thank you, commissioner. If, if I could add one thing, 'cause Jenna did remind me. I, I talked a lot about Edge, but most of those community, most of those projects that result from our equity funding, and I could think about nine or 10 or 12 different small business parks that we've developed around the state. It's what you're describing earlier. And I, I just got focused on, you know, one program versus the other. So thank you. Thank you, commissioner. We're gonna, we're gonna have our next presenter from the Georgia Department of Audits, our state auditor, Mr. Greg Griffin. All right. Uh, I will also try to get you back on schedule, uh, as well. So, good afternoon, uh, Mr. Chairman or chairmans, uh, members of the council. I am Greg Griffin. I'm the state auditor. Uh, thank you for the opportunity to be here today to talk to you about an important",

        text: "issue, uh, that, that y'all just finished, uh, talking about, uh, I think I'm gonna frame this up as a potential emerging issue and in terms of good government and accountability. So I'm gonna dive right in. I'm gonna tee this up as noted on this first page. Under state law, local governments are required to submit audited financial information to my office annually, within 180 days of their respective fiscal year ends. So each year we see governments fail to turn in their financial information to us, either timely or at all. And the number of governments, uh, failing to submit timely is trending upwards. So we see an uptick, uh, in the, in the amount of non-compliance. As you're gonna see on a later slide, I'm gonna present, we've got about 26 cities that have three or more open years of, uh, where they have not filed any reports. So we're gonna, we're gonna go over that, uh, in some detail. As, as Christopher said earlier, uh, the statute that we're operating under, it ties non-compliance to the receipt of state funds. And it looks back over the previous five years, uh, five year period. So I, I think there's a bigger issue than just access to funds. I think, you know, failure to be audited and provide annual financial reports, uh, keeps the public in the dark about how public money is being used. And it impairs the decision making of the management and the elected officials. And this correlates to the fact, uh, over the last six months to a year, we've seen an uptick in the number of citizen complaints that have, uh, called into my office. Uh, they are not concerned about getting additional funds. They're wanting me to help, uh, in terms of, is that local government preparing their budget correctly? They want to know how their public funds are being spent. Uh, my taxes are going up. Uh, why, uh, where did my COVID funds go? Where were those funds spent? So it's, it's, and, and some of you in this room are, are also receiving those calls from citizens as well. So, uh, I think, again, it's more, uh, larger than just access to funds. It is a transparency, uh, and oversight, uh, issue. At the bottom of this page, you can see who is required to submit annual financial information to my office. It's local governments. That means cities, counties, consolidated governments, authorities, and regional commissions. So why does this matter? So we, we believe if you get public funds, you should be held accountable for those funds. And accountability means it is, it is the auditing process and the reporting process that we have in place. And what's on the slide here is, is basically a description of the slippery slope that we see in see a number of cities, uh, going down today. We fail to submit one report, then we fail to submit consecutive reports and significant issues that are unresolved can lead these organizations to having records that are more difficult to audit. And in some cases, in, in a, in a number of cities that we're actually working with right now, they're unaudited, their records are in such bad shape, they are literally unaudited. So for the, for a period of five years, as Christopher said, they are prohibited from having access to either state funds grants, so they can't go to Christopher to d c a to get those funds that can't access funds, that the Department of Transportation, Elm, I believe is the, they can't go to G F A, uh, and borrow, uh, funds for, uh, you know, water and infrastructure. So, but again, it's more than access to funds, I believe it is, again, a transparency, uh, and oversight issue. So, on this slide, yep, here we go. Uh, so I've got an interactive, uh, page here. So this is the filing status of cities. I do wanna point out from here on out, the conversation is really about cities, uh, and smaller cities, counties are, are doing a pretty good job. So this is less about counties, more about cities. So this is the filing status, uh, for the last five years. I ask that you pay attention to, uh, the, the blue area and the red area on the graph. So I'm just gonna, I'm gonna move from one year to the next. So in 2000, uh, 18, uh, 52% of cities turned in their reports on time. And, uh, we currently have 1.32 of those cities, uh, of total cities, uh, have not submitted. We'll, we'll look at those guys in a minute. 2019, 60% on time, a little bit of increase on not submitted next year, sort of the same thing. We've got 60% on time, a little bit of increase here, uh, up to 5.27%, uh, on those, uh, cities that have not submitted. Here's where the trend begins to, uh, head in a different direction. So we go from 60% on time. We go down to 40% in 2021. All right? And we now have 9.43% of cities that have not submitted reports in 22. In 2022, the most recent year, we have that 40% goes down to 32%. And, and right now we have 41% of all cities have not reported for 2022. Now, over time, some of these, the, the group that's in the non-admitted category, they will turn in reports, they'll just be late. They're not timely. Uh, but that will, they usually take a couple of years to work through that process. But they, I think the key thing here is we've gone from 60% on time down to 32%. So, uh, why, why, what's going on? So based on outreach that, that we've had, uh, with, uh, these various cities, uh, over the last five years, this, this list that you see here, these are the, I guess, the emerging themes of why they haven't, uh, turned in their audit reports. They're difficult to obtain an audit turnover illness. We did go through the period of covid. Uh, sometimes they have lack of information and, and they are changing auditors from time to time. I do think this turnover issue is, is going to be a larger issue in the, in the years to come, given the shortage of accountants and financials graduates that you hear, uh, in the public. So, uh, I, I do think that that, uh, issue is, is, is going to loom, uh, lar a little larger in the future. So on this slide here, what, what we've done, and this is by the way, this is an interactive, uh, document. We are going to, uh, you can get a link to this and you can, uh, work your way through this yourself. But over here, we, we have listed the specific cities in this chart. And on this chart, uh, we've listed those cities that are three or more in arrears in their filings. All right? And, and so in total, in this chart, uh, there are 26 cities. So you can, again, you'll be able to scroll up and down to see who those, whether you're I'm, I can, Oh, we, we'll, we'll, we'll, we can give you a P D F and you can have access to this, to this software. I want A copy of That. You, you got it. You got it. But so you, you'll see the list. You can see that they are at least 3, 20, 26 cities. They represent 5% of all cities. And in this chart, there are seven cities that have not reported for all five years on that. You can see here now, many, many of these seven cities haven't reported since 2014. So, so they're more than, they haven't reported for more than five years. We just drop them off after five years, because that's what the statute focuses in on. So again, this, this group here, three or more, where they have not filed, we, we, I, we've labeled this group at risk. That's not an official term. We've labeled them at risk. The further you go away from the current period, the harder it is to audit those entities and, and their records. So this, on this list, we, we've labeled these the endangered group.",

        text: "So these are our cities that haven't filed for two or more years, or one or two years. In this group. Again, you'll be able to scroll down and find your city. All right? And again, you'll, you'll have access to this piece of software. Wow. There are 192 cities on this list. They represent 36% of the Georgia cities, and a total of 217 reports that haven't been filed over the last five years. So, to take a look at the information a little differently on this, uh, chart, uh, you can, we'll, we'll show you where these, uh, governments, they haven't reported where they, where they, where they are located. So you'll see the distribution across the state by county. Uh, and I think you'll note that this particular issue is not specific to a particular part of the state. So we've grouped this particular chart between the at-risk group and the endangered group. And so here are the 26 cities, you'll be able to hover over a particular county. And you can see in this particular one, just again, this is Oglethorpe Down in H Georgia, Mac Max, the city of Max's, five years missing max Five, Clinch, uh, again, I'm just randomly here. So Homer V, three years missing. Um, I'm working with, uh, a, the city of Aragon right now, they, they, again, they're missing five years plus, Come on down to right below Savannah, right? Hey, go bridge. What's the biggest reason, Pardon me? The Biggest, The biggest reason, uh, again, turnover. They don't have, they don't have the staff to prepare their financial statements and do the good stewardship that, uh, Christopher was talking about. I think, I think that's, I think that's probably one of the biggest issues. What is It again? I'm Sorry. Staffing. Having qualified folks to keep track of their information. And, uh, they're, they're having to, uh, they can't keep staff on, on hand, and they're having to outsource that, the accounting, if you will, to, uh, others consultants or other accounting firms. And, and again, they're, it's getting pretty expensive, uh, these days, Sir. So you've Identified a problem. Um, so when my kids were small, they're in the house, and I'd say, you gotta clean your room up before we go somewhere and said, oh, I'll get to a daddy. I know it's important, I'll get to it. And then sometimes they didn't until I gave them an incentive. Correct. To clean the room. Yes, sir. Is the next part of your presentation incentives that we could provide to I Have some suggestions. Thank you. Uh, I didn't call mine. I have some suggestions again. So, so we are, we are, again, statutes prohibit me from actually going in and doing work. I, I collect and I report, I, and, uh, I can't force my department to go audit them, but if they ask me for help, I can go audit. And that's sort of the case we've got with a couple cities right now. So, uh, but I do have a couple suggestions here in a second. So these are the 26. You can also click over here on the endangered group. So you can see that they're, these, these counties have one city that are in arrears rears here. In this, in this particular group, uh, the gold, uh, these, uh, are cities that have two, uh, I'm sorry, counties that have two or more cities that are in arrears. You can do the same thing. You can hover over these, you can see which cities, Counties promise later on. Yep. I will, I will send this to you. Uh, again, we'll get this link to you, but again, you can hover over the counties and see which cities, uh, are in arrears and how many years they're in arrears. So again, the at risk, there's 26, a hundred unfiled reports. The endangered grouped, the 192 with 217,000, or I'm sorry, 217 reports. So We do have a couple of questions. So, so, so I do have a couple solutions. Why don't you go ahead and finish, and Then we'll, right. So this, this is my last slide. I do have a couple, uh, recommendations given, uh, our, the current status, uh, our statutes that we're in. Uh, before I do that, just to frame this up, uh, with an overall perspective, I do wanna say most local governments are accountable. Uh, they are being audited, and they are providing financial information to our office. So I think this issue represents a small group that aren't meeting the, uh, state's legal requirements. So let me, let me put that out there first and in contacts with some of these recommendations. So the first one is, we can possibly ease the burden, uh, for some of these smaller cities. So current gap, current accounting is pretty complex. The, the accounting rules, they have to submit two sets of books. The, the sets of books are on different bases of accounting. It's, it's very complex. So one consideration would be to allow them to submit one set of books on one basis of accounting, easiest being cash, not accrual, not modified accrual, but cash basis. So that in the private sector, the private sector has done something similar. They have issued different, a different accounting and reporting framework for small and medium sized businesses, as opposed instead of large companies, those that file, you know, the Fortune 100 guys. So they, they've come up with a different framework, large gap, small gap for private sector, regulatory basis of accounting. It would be small gap for governmental entities, smaller cities. You might want to define a size, uh, that you would apply this to. Uh, so I, I think there's a way to ease the burden. Do small governmental gap. You can deliver useful and, uh, relevant information, but on a more cost effective basis, you might not have to hire all the consultants or hire, you know, the staff to, again, to keep up with cash basis accounting. Uh, the, the next item on the list here is let's not let these guys get into this situation to begin with and not have to, uh, you know, address the issue. Let's create an early warning system that helps identify that folks and, and you know where they're going so that we can prevent them from getting into the situation, uh, to begin with. So, uh, we've done something similar in my office. We've created a, an early warning, a financial dashboard, if you will, for the local school boards. And, and so you could do something similar. You could look at different ratios and metrics, and you can see if there's any deterioration that takes place. You can then perhaps take some, some action, some preventative action, which really leads into the, the third bullet on the list up there is to come up with some, uh, checklist, uh, for triggers for action. Uh, develop some predetermined actions when certain triggers or gates are hit. So we are aware, and that could take a, it could fall on a, a continuum where we, I know of some state auditors, they collect information, they report to the legislature. The legislature then acts on a case by case basis on s another scenario at the other end of the continuum, uh, the state auditor tracks, they have an early warning system. They actually go in and do remediation and re rehabilitation again at various points. So you actually, you're taking action before it gets to the point where their records become un auditable. So those are my suggestions for you to think about, uh, as, as again, Well, you have certainly hit on something that's very important for the, the members here. Uh, but thank you. Go ahead And hit the question. Okay. We got a couple of questions. Uh, representative Al Williams in Representative Lynn Smith. Let me ask you, sir, I've, I've seen it, and it's interesting what a great case has been made here for less cities. But if you don't have staff Toronto City, You shouldn't have a city. And, and, and we do know that cities serve at the pleasure of the legislature in Georgia. We used to pull charters for speed traps. It has happened at Mountain View near, uh, airport. And I looked at Darien up there. I can drive to Darien right now, and there'll be five or six Darien police cars on the interstate",

So what we miss in all of our conversations is as we are charged with fiduciary responsibilities for the citizens of the state, as difficult as it is to make some of these decisions, you've given us a lot of information. If this isn't a broken window to let you know which house to live in, I don't know what is. Thank you, Bill. Thank you. Am I on? Okay. Thank you for your presentation. It's very eye-opening. In your experience, are the elected officials always aware that this is happening in their communities, or, I believe most they know. I I think they know. You think so? Most of 'em know. They Should be. They should be. Yep. I think in some of the smaller communities, they might not even be aware. But, uh, I'm not, you know, because not a lot of communication there and that kind of thing. So I'm not, not sure. I'm not out driving around, but I, I think they would know or should definitely know as, as elected officials. And I think it's good stewards after the fact though. And I think, yeah, I would definitely, a lot of it is, but, uh, and we have found a lot of that. Go ahead. Thank you Chair. Recognized representative Lisa Hagen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your presentation. Maybe what we're talking about here, uh, representative Williams, uh, would be interesting if we apply it in light of our consolidation conversation this morning. Just a thought, but, uh, my question is, I just wanna clarify something. So you said for these cities who are not submitting their audit, they cannot receive, they're not receiving state funds. They That's correct. They're prohibited. Does that include mig? Yeah, MIG as well. They cannot go to Department of Transportation. They Already aren't. Okay. That's correct. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, uh, representative Patty Bentley, do you have another question? Yes. This is the last one we gotta move On. Can you all hear me? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you Mr. Griffin, for your presentation. And I certainly agree to everything that's been said here today. Um, but one of my colleagues just mentioned about does the local elected officials know this? Yes. I, yes, they know. My question is, how can we make sure that the citizens know? Because that's what I learned. A lot of people in those cities are not aware that their city's financial, uh, future is not looking very bright. So what can we do to ensure that the people of those communities are aware that there are elected local officials or delinquent on their, uh, audit reporting to the, to the State Department of Bodies? Looking at the chart, I bet you the people, Can we put an article on the front page of the paper, the local newspaper? Can we do that? Rise Up? Let's make sure that that is directed to the speaker question. Yes. I, I, I believe part of the process in the statute is to, uh, make the local community aware that they are in arrears on their reports. Uh, I need to go back and see, you know, to what extent we're doing that. I, I, we may have stopped that 10 years ago or so, but I believe there the possibility is there should be some, uh, notice being put into, uh, you know, local newspapers. So I'll, I'll, I'll go back and, and see about that. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Griffin. You've really opened our eyes here to some issues, and we're going to be depending on you and legislative council to look at some of the possibilities that you can guide us on, uh, for coming legislation. Thank You very much. Thanks for having Me. Thank you. We're running a little bit behind, uh, but we, we are now ready for, uh, mark Wes, Mark Watson, if you'll come on up. Didn't we get rid of one? Thank y'all for being here. And, uh, anytime that you're ready to start, please proceed. Yes, sir. Thank you for having us, Mr. Chairman. Uh, we're here with the Department of Labor. My name's Wesley Ross. I am the Deputy Commissioner of External and Legislative Affairs. Um, they're passing y'all out. Uh, just a gift from the commissioner. We wanna make sure that, uh, y'all know that we, we appreciate all that y'all do and, uh, the partnerships that we're looking to continue to build. Um, we also have some labor packets, I think they'll be passing out, uh, that we tried to coattail down to your communities. So maybe that'll be helpful for you. Um, before I turned over to Mark, who's really the expert on this issue, I just wanted to, uh, give a message to the commissioner. He hates that he is not here today. Um, he appreciates the work that y'all do, you know, be, uh, serving in the other side for, uh, several years. And, um, as we work to continue to, to fix this agency and, and the problems that we solve over the past several years, uh, we just appreciate the partnership. We're trying to change it around and look, feel, and be different. And, um, if the commissioner's here, I know he, he will give you a lot of examples of that. And we look forward during the legislative session to come to y'all and show you some of the big changes that we have made. Um, so with that, I'm gonna turn over to Mark Watson, who is, uh, the director of our labor market information, and, uh, can get into some of the details about rural Georgia. Thank y'all for having us. Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you, uh, chairmans Green and Jackson for having us. And on top of what Wesley just said, uh, I'm a 32 year, uh, employee of the Labor department, 28 years in labor market information, and 12 as a director. And in these first seven months, I really appreciate, uh, the efforts of Commissioner Bruce Thompson coming in and, uh, doing all he's done. Uh, we look forward to, uh, the next few years, uh, really, uh, you know, making some changes and, uh, and doing some good for, uh, for the state of Georgia. Um, so I'm here to, uh, talk about, uh, labor market information. Um, I really en have enjoyed all of the presentations. I particularly got a lot out of Dr. Bridges and representative, uh, Washburn this morning, uh, talking about, uh, infrastructure and broadband and whatnot. Um, because, uh, as, as we know, there are a lot of barriers to, uh, rural growth. And, uh, you know, just up here we look at, uh, you know, the workforce, uh, jobs, uh, employment, educational attainment. Um, healthcare is a big important issue, um, having a trained workforce. Uh, so everything that's listed up there, everything that we want to discuss today, um, I'm gonna focus on, uh, a certain element of the state and, and the data will show why. Um, but I am gonna look at some economic barriers that include poverty rates, personal income, um,",

        text: "literacy and educational attainment. Um, and then, uh, we're going to look into some industry growth and some potential for growth. And we're gonna look at things like, um, trade programs, education on the job training, and, uh, career pathways, all important, uh, topics to discuss. Um, here's our state broken out by the 12 regions. We're going to be focused on middle Georgia, central, Savannah River, river Valley, heart of Georgia, and then southwest in southern Georgia. And, uh, the data will show you why. Uh, I will say that when I was first, uh, you know, we had our phone call, uh, back a while back talking about this. The first thing I did was research, uh, your committee and found the data that the Terry Business College has put out. So I, I wanted to not replicate that. I wanted to point to something a little different. I, I hope I've done that, although I will be looking at some of those data points, but kind of updating them, um, you know, looking at a three year stretch and then an over the years stretch in some of these numbers. So, uh, with that, we'll get started. Um, right here we take a look at, um, this is the population and labor force percent change over a three year period, annual data from 2019 to 2022. And I know y'all are back far from the, uh, uh, graph here. So the far left side is just Georgia as a whole. And then we started northwest Georgia, work our way all the way down to Northeast Georgia, hit middle Georgia, back to River Valley, hard of, and then the southern portion of the state, and then coastal at the end. So when you look at the population in labor force change, uh, obviously, I mean, in northeast and middle Georgia, we see some population growth, but we're seeing the labor force decline. And then central Savannah River and River Valley, uh, declines in both. And then, uh, not a lot of action either way down, uh, in the southern portion of the state. Similarly, we're gonna look at average monthly employment. You see the same thing, uh, when you get to middle Georgia all the way down to Southern Georgia. You see, um, a decline in the average monthly employment. So that's troubling. That's, and it's not something that's unfamiliar to me. Uh, I mentioned I've been in labor market information for 28 years, and, uh, you know, I've looked at this data before, and, uh, so it wasn't surprising, but when you do your research and look at it, it, it's troubling. Um, but nonetheless, what I did want to do, as well as point out some positives, and I took some of the same data points, and I looked at over the year, July 22 to July 23. And as you can see, it paints a bit of a different picture here. We're looking at the labor force and the number of employed together, and well, what do you know, river Valley in, in the, over the last year has had the biggest growth in both, uh, with middle Georgia doing pretty well, right there with Northeast Georgia. We were talking about Northeast Georgia earlier. Uh, I mean, that, that area has really, really grown in the last 10 years. Uh, I, I live up in Forsyth County, and I've seen the Georgia Mountain area grow, but I've really been looking at Northeast Georgia here, uh, over the last, uh, two or three years. Um, so you can see we still, you know, have small numbers or declining numbers in the southern part of the state. Uh, but I did just wanna show that, you know, okay, we looked at a three year period, but over the, over the last 12 months, we, we've seen some, some improvement. Um, so we showed, uh, some employment growth. So where is that growth? So starting to the left, we have middle Georgia, central Savannah River, heart of Southern, or Southwest and Southern. And I just looked at, uh, the sectors where we had the most growth. And you see growth in healthcare, finance and insurance, accommodation and food services, construction, wholesale trade. Uh, we've got some finance and insurance manufacturing. Um, what I found interesting, and we're gonna talk about this in southwest Georgia, there was growth in professional scientific and technical services. And I'm going to focus on that a little bit as we move forward. So there's where the job growth has been, and again, this is net change over a three year period for, for these six areas that we're focusing on. Um, so let's talk about some of these economic barriers that I mentioned at the onset. The poverty rate in Georgia is 14%. And, uh, as you see by the data, we have 66 counties with a poverty rate of 20% or more, and I think it's 2025 that are 25% or more. And, uh, 88% of those that are 20% or more are in the six regions. And those that are 25% or higher, every one of those counties are in these six regions. And it's very similar. When you look at the personal income, it's the exact same thing. Um, you know, uh, 88% that are, um, under 45,000. And then you have a couple of dozen that are under 40,000. And again, it's in, it is in these, all the counties, in these six areas. Um, so moving on from that, we're gonna look at literacy rates. And I wanna explain this just a little bit. Literacy rate, the P I A A C program is a, a study of measuring and comparing adult basic skills in literacy, numeracy, and digital problem solving. And, um, Georgia ranked 38th in the nation, which isn't stellar as a state as a whole, with a score of two 60. And, uh, we had 33 of 35 counties in one of the five regions. That's that, uh, scored two 40 or below middle Georgia was excluded. There were no counties in middle Georgia that fell into that group. Um, and if you look at education, educational attainment, post-secondary education in the, in the metro area, 35% of the labor force between the ages of 18 and 65 have, uh, attained, uh, a bachelor degree or higher. And as it says up here, the second closest region is northeast Georgia at 20%. Um, and every other region, with exception to the Atlanta Regional area, um, have more high school graduates than they do, um, bachelor of Science graduates. Um, I didn't put it on the slide, but I read something I found very interesting. If you annexed Metro Atlanta, and it was its own state, it's educational attainment with trail only Massachusetts, the rest of the state would be in the lower quad quadrant, um, as a whole, in terms of educational attainment down, down with Mississippi. Um, I found that startling. Um, but, uh, you know, when you do research, you can uncover, uh, some interesting things in data. Uh, so let's move on. Enough about the barriers. I want to talk about, um, you know, what we're here to talk about, solutions, ideas. Um, if you look at the, uh, state's overall employment, regardless of any sector of the state, you're going to see the most jobs are gonna be in healthcare, retail, trade, and accommodation and food services. That's true. Anywhere you'd look in any research I've done any trends analysis report. I've written up for three different commissioners now, um, you're gonna see that, uh, as a matter of fact, in the country, nine of the top 10 occupations require no more than a high school degree. And they're low, low-paying jobs. They're necessary jobs, but they're not jobs to grow a region economically. Um, when I was really reaching for something different to talk about it, it, this is what I came up with. I noticed that the Atlanta metropolitan area similarly has these same occupations. Again, you need 'em everywhere you go, everywhere you look. But where metro Atlanta really is very different from, uh, the southern region of the state is robust job growth and job numbers as a whole in the professional, scientific and technical sector. Um, so I probably redid this presentation four or five times, and I'm like, nah, this isn't really telling anything new, but, but this just popped out at me, so I, I decided to go with it. Um, so I've got listed here, uh, and again, I don't know if you can see it, but, you know, professional and scientific and technical jobs include accounting and bookkeeping, tax prep, payroll, architecture, engineering, specialize in design, computer systems, technical management and scientific consulting, research and development and, and and such. Um, so these are jobs that require high educational attainment. Um, they require, of course, uh, jobs to be available. And, um, you know, to pursue a, a job in this, this field, you, you, you know, you, you need opportunities. So, um, education is important. Um, I'm thankful for mine. Uh, I love working with numbers. I feel very fortunate to have had the career I've had. Um, at the same token, I've got friends, I've got, uh, nephews who don't, didn't necessarily, you know, want to go down the educational pathway and, and, you know, there's an outlet for them too. And, uh, well, I'm, I'm getting one slide ahead of myself. Um, I'll talk about that.",

        text: "Or have I skipped? Uh, sorry. Um, I did want, this is important. I wanted to talk about this. So, in all, Georgia has about 48,000 establishments and 320,000 employment in professional scientific and technical services. The Atlanta Regional Commission accounts for basically 60% of the establishments and 70% of the employment. If you take the remaining northern regions in ad coastal, and of course take out Atlanta, they account for like 22 and 32%. So for the six, uh, regions of focus here today, that leaves 9% of the establishments and 9% of employment. I mentioned earlier that southwest Georgia, over that three year period showed a growth of 5% in professional scientific and technical service jobs. Uh, the other five regions, the growth was either flat in two of them, and in three, there was actually decline over that three year period. Um, so with that said, there it is on a graph, I think the graph, uh, hits home with that even, even more so than just, uh, you know, or orating the numbers. Uh, so, you know, that's, that's, that's, that's interesting. Now, here's where I was going with trade and on the job training. Um, there is certainly a need for occupations that do not require a four year degree. They're essential to any area. Um, and, uh, on the job training from apprenticeship programs all the way down to different levels of on-the-job training, uh, you know, your electricians, your carpenters, your, uh, retails, your, uh, plumbers and pipe fitters, um, heavy and tractor trailer truck drivers. I have a friend I grew up with. We played little league sports together, and he, he didn't have the opportunities that, that, thankfully my parents provided me. And, uh, today he lives on Lake, uh, Sinclair makes six figures a year driving a tractor trailer. And, uh, you know, he's on the road a lot, but he makes a good living. So he, so he found his opportunity, he made the best of it. Um, accounting, bookkeeping, maintenance and repair workers, welders, we need, you know, welders, I remember several years ago that was the hot button topic of the day. We couldn't find welders, um, anywhere, uh, for certain, especially in coastal Georgia. Um, so anyway, so there's the different type of occupations, uh, that, that you can have with, uh, you know, without a degree and you can have a good career. And that's important. Again, every region of the state needs every one of these occupations. Um, so just to close out here, uh, broadband was mentioned earlier, and, uh, yeah, on the, I, I really, uh, like to look at a different, different websites for research. So the Department of Community Affairs has real good information on, uh, the broadband growth in our state since the inception of this program in what, 20, you know, 2018. Uh, and there has been a lot of, uh, a lot of growth and a lot of good things done with this program. At the same time, if you look at the, there's a map of the state, uh, there's still, there's still a ways to go. And it's primarily heart of Georgia and the southern, uh, really southwest and southern Georgia, where we still need some broadband and wifi. Um, this is really important and, and outreach to the, the youth, to the younger workers in all kind of different skills. I, I've been amazed at some of the employees we've hired that were were smart, that could do the type of work we needed them to do, but they, they just, they had no soft skills. I literally had to sit down with one or two of them and, and just kind of explain things that I just took for granted that everybody knew in, in terms of, uh, conduct in the workplace. Um, so, you know, soft skills, life skills, job and trade skills, it, it's so important to, I mean, today more than ever, we have gotta focus on our young workforce. Take a look at that next, you're probably aware of this, but by 2030, uh, all the baby boomers are going to be 65 and over, and in about 7, 8, 9 years, we are gonna have more people in this country age 65 or over than we have 18 and younger. And that has the potential to be a problem. You, you think it's tough finding workers now. Uh, that's why we gotta have outreach. I mean, there's, there's been a lot of important topics brought up today. Uh, the infrastructure, uh, from Dr. Bridges earlier was I was out talking to him for a little bit that, you know, I don't, I don't do that type of research in my data, but I know it's there. And to hear it and see it and kind of correlate that with what I'm talking about, it's all important. But, but we've gotta reach out and, and make sure that we have, uh, the young people ready for the workforce for tomorrow or today, really. Um, and, you know, finally, um, I'll close with this, um, career pathway alignment. It's been talked about for years and there's been a lot of good work in this area, but it needs to continue. And that's partnerships with the educational community, the workforce development community and employers in, in every region of this state that, that has to take place. Everybody has to be on the same page. Here's what we need, here's, here's, here's the training we need to provide our young people. And, uh, you know, communication is key in anything. And, and that's a big part of communication that I see is very necessary. Uh, and with that, um, I'll close out and, uh, take any questions. Thank you so much, mark Markel, I hope that you'll supply that information to, uh, Leo and where we can, uh, look at it and we're gonna be coming back to you asking for, uh, uh, more information. And because this is very important to the, the people of the state of Georgia, and we really appreciate you coming today on that. Do we have any questions from the committee? More? Okay, Thank you. Thank you, mark, for that presentation. I worked for the labor department. I started in 1979. Alright. Uh, back in the old days. Yeah. But we had, um, and, and you talked about customer service and young people not having the job skills and whatnot, but we, when we were at the labor department, we had what was called the Old Cedar A program. Yes. Also, we had the Job Corps programs that we would send kids to kids at risk, we would send 'em to Job Corps, and then the Job Corps programs had college, they could, uh, aspire to go to college while they were in the Job Corps programs. Are some of those similar programs still in existence, or are you all thinking about I instituting something similar to those programs? Yeah. Over the years, those programs you mentioned. Uh, you know, I did a lot of work with Commissioner Thurman and, uh, commissioner Butler, and Now I was way back before then. Yeah. And you're way back, you probably, I think Al Scott was there when I started. So you, you go back further in that Sam Caldwell, if you want, if you want to know who it was, that was Sam Caldwell. I've heard a lot of the Sam Cald Caldwell stories with the department. A lot of stories, But, uh, uh, but we do, I mean, there are programs there, and I know, uh, I don't, Wesley I don't know if you want to talk on this, but, uh, you know, the commissioner, uh, Thompson is very much in touch with that as well as, uh, outreach to, um, the, uh, Ry the Reentry Program. You know, that's something that he's really passionate about. And hey, you know what, when you're struggling to find workers to fill your workforce, and you got people who have whatever they've done, they've paid their debt and they've, they've shown that they're ready to come out and, and make a life for themselves. Th there's something there. There's, uh, a group that can be tapped into as well. So, thank you. Alright, chair recognized representative Patty Bentley. Thank you, your Honor. Thank you for your presentation. Can we go back a moment, please to another, the, the slide before this? I believe it was that one. Mm-hmm. Um, I noticed the list of, um, programs you have list here, which are really good. We do, we definitely need electricians, plumbers, and all of those. But I'm just curious, this is a serious question. Um, is there any, have there ever ever been any consideration in looking into the funeral industry? Because from where I'm, where I stand and what I see in rural Georgia, um, there's very few people in the pipeline to become the next funeral director and license embalmer in this state. So has that been a consideration for the Department of Labor? Yeah, that's a good question. You know, this information here, just to be brief with it, we produce a poster really for, uh, high schools. Okay. And, and we do STEM jobs, hot careers, and then we recently created on the job training. So I pulled this data directly from that. So what this represents as a state as a whole is jobs that have higher than the average, uh, wages, higher growth rate than, than typical and, and whatnot. So to drill down mm-hmm. Like to your area specifically, and to that occupation, there's a plethora of occupations on that poster. And, and that might very well be on there. Uh, but we try to, I mean, we have, what, 860 some odd occupations and, uh, uh, you know, we, we project every single occupation that we have. So,",

So it's there. So, so thank you for that question. And lastly, if I just, just a comment, Mr. Chairman, if I may right quick. Um, and thank you for your response. And as when I think of, look at the word apprenticeship colleagues, I think we could probably address this issue if we consider a decreasing the number of hours of, of apprenticeship to become a licensed funeral director in the state of Georgia, which is over 3000. And I understand to be a nurse, I think it's less than 3000. So that's just something food for thoughtful right now. That's an interesting point. I recognize Representative Cle, Uh, thank you Mr. Chair. But in light of, um, my, uh, my fondness for Dr. Latimore, uh, who comes next? Uh, I know Representative Bentley wasn't thinking about giving him enough time to make his presentation. I'd like to make mine offline. Okay. Thank you. Alright. You are a good man. Thank you. Thank you so much for the presentation and we look forward to working with y'all in the can. Thank you for, uh, thinking us of, of this tell the commissioner we appreciate this. Thanks so much. Our next speaker, I'm gonna let Representative Patty Bentley introduce him Gladly. Ladies and gentlemen, friends of Fort Valley State University, I present to you none other than Dr. Mark Latimore from the College of Agricultural on the beautiful campus of the Fort Valley State University. I ask that you please direct your attention to the front of the room so we can listen very carefully of all the good things that Dr. Latimore is going to share with us about all of the agriculture programs at the Fort Valley State University, which is one of two land grant institutions in the state of Georgia. Uh, thank, thank you. Representative Bentley. Uh, I, I am the associate, uh, administrator for, uh, the Associate Dean for our corporate extension program. Also Extension, extension Administrator. Uh, I was born and raised in southwest Georgia. Uh, it's a, it is a, it is a metropolitan city between Columbus and or Albany on five 20, exactly halfway place called Western Georgia. Uh, when we, when we, uh, Representative Benley indicated that there are two 18, uh, there are two land grant universities in the state of Georgia. And with the, with the Land grant purpose, we focus on teaching research and extension. So at Fort Valley State University, when we look at teaching, I just highlight just a few things that, uh, we are engaged in that in the under, under the teaching program. Our student enrollment, like most of the schools in the system this fall, is, is looking good. They're up. So we are very pleased about that compared, especially compared to last year. Uh, we have an organization called mannar, minorities and Agriculture, natural Resource and Related Sciences. And through this program, we provide leadership opportunities as well as, uh, mentorship opportunity for our undergraduate students. Primarily. Academic Forum is another college organization that we used to provide leadership, uh, training we had this year, we had for the first time a meat judging contest for animal science. They went out to Colorado back here earlier and, uh, for the first time, and they placed. So we are very excited, uh, about the accomplishments, uh, agriculture, future of America, student research across the country, student abroad, uh, internship. These are opportunities that we use in order to afford our op, our student growth opportunities. We was talking, uh, mark was talking about the soft skills, uh, several years ago. Uh, the technical college, the local industry education group as well. Uh, we was part of a survey. And in that survey, one of the things that's really stood out was the need for soft skills in our, in our young, in our students. And just recently, I had an opportunity to talk with the, the director of, uh, Bibb County Development Authority. And one of the things during the course of the conversation, one of the things that I asked him, I said, industry, the way, the way industry is moving in Macon, in, in, in Bibb Macon County, uh, what do we need to do in order to prepare our students? And his comment to me was that when he talked with, uh, members from the, from the, from several of the industry, uh, they said, well, look, we can provide the training, the job training, but one of the things that we definitely are looking for, uh, is looking for is those soft skills. Those soft skills. So they are very critical as it relates to our, our students. So we have scholarships and teaching grants. Uh, this year through U S D A, uh, 1890 grant, uh, we had 81 students, uh, U SS d a, which is another 1890, uh, grant Target, 1890s. But, uh, oh, 12 students. Plant science, bio technology scholarship, 31 and one. One of the things that we do, we, we try to offer job opportunity to students in the College of Agriculture as well as students outside the College of Agriculture and Extension Research, uh, as well, as well as on the farm. So as we see here, we have students that's both in all categories, that's in the layout. Uh, and well, as, as on the outside, one of the things that we learned over the years that the young lady was more aptt to get on the track, to get on the combine a lot faster than the guys. So, uh, so that, that, that was, you repeat that, that that was kind of interesting. Uh, we have a safe center associated with our veterinary technology area. This is a, this is a center that was funded by the state several years ago and and attached to our veterinary technology area. So with the Safe Center, we can house, I think, 80 dogs and about a hundred cats. And when we have a situation like we are about to have, uh, and ho hopefully will not be as bad, but this is an opportunity during emergency. We, we, and we have done this over the years, uh, house horses as well as, uh, uh, dogs. Now, we also have housed, it is also used, uh, as a shelter for animals, which have been abused. So we have done that as well as well, especially from, uh, Bibb County. Uh, research. In our research component, as I indicated, we had a teach in the research as well as the extension component. So with our research component, uh, in this past fiscal year, uh, we have received over $5.7 million in external funds. Uh, this is in addition to our capacity fund that we get. We have about 50 graduate students in the master level, 30 under undergraduate level. Were employed by the AG Research Station, over 70 publications and conference, conference paper. Were done by our research components. And we have a strong collaborative network. Uh, many of you might be familiar, uh, if not, uh, uh, we have a meat processing facility, uh, in the meat processing facility. We process goats. We process sheeps. Uh, no, we process goats. We process sheep, uh, beef cattle as well as hog. We do not process deer. Uh, you gotta Get in. No, no deer. So this is just an, uh, shot of, of some, uh, some of the goats that we have, uh, sheep that we have. And in addition to the processing process and process and addition to processing, we also package and label. So, in other words, you can bring, you can bring your cow in, have it have it slaughtered, uh, and, and the way you want it processed. Uh, we can also label that for value added effect. We have thanks through the state to, to the Commissioner Ag. We have a, an inspector on site. Whenever we kill that inspector must be there to examine the, uh, the animal animal, uh, collaboration with, uh, we have collaborative project with U g, uh, U G A as well as a r s on, uh, commodity crops. A colleague of mine is doing some work with sorghum trials. Uh, they're using robotics to see what's under the, under the leaves on the ground on the floor, and then, and also drones with their colleagues out of the tif, the Tifton area, I think. So that, that is going well. Uh, few years ago, well, a couple years ago, uh, we collaborated with U S D, uh, a R A SS and u and U G A and aox aflatoxin com, uh, contamination study in peanuts. Uh, this is one that has really, has really taken off and, and shows a lot of interest with the, uh, peanut commissioners. Uh, improving the pecan food safety through non-thermal technology is another, uh, collaborative prop, uh, project that we are involved in. Now, I must ask this question. Uh, one of the things that, that we have said over the years was that if you are south of Mac, the pecans, if you're north of Mac's pecan. So where we are now, uh, is it pecan? Pecan? Okay. Alright. Then cut. In our corporate extension area, uh, we, we see, we see a lot of opportunities in the rural community. And, uh, in our corporate extension for this year,",

And we are actively involved with Ecop Extension Committee on policies, uh, through A P L U, uh, on Farm Bill matters. Uh, we are working, uh, both, uh, like in Georgia, Laura, yours truly, we are working with our colleagues across the country to make sure that our ask from extension purpose is placed in the farm bill thus far. That, that is going well. As far as the, uh, conversation that's taken place, that has taken place up to the b the A P L A P L U level. So we are very excited about that from corporate extension purpose. We do have, uh, agents in the field. We need more agents in the field. Uh, we are also looking to, to hire some that have retired just recently. But the blue, the blue counties that you see on the, on the screen indicates the counties where we, uh, have agents that serve primarily. But our service area is not limited to those counties. Uh, we do not have an agent in every county, uh, with the exception of maybe one location. Uh, our agents, uh, co-op with, uh, our U S G, uh, U G A colleagues. And it, it has, it has been a work of a work of a relationship over the years. Uh, as I stated, we are in the process of, uh, replacing agents in those, in those blue areas. We're also in the process of, uh, looking to expand, especially in the southwest Georgia area, the rural area that's, uh, really depressed in a lot of instances. As I stated a few minutes ago, I grew up in Western, so there are many challenges in Western. We, Westford County, Stewart County and Clay County in that area. So we are trying to, uh, trying to get more engaged and, and, and putting PE put, putting boots on the ground there. Uh, in our corporate extension program, we have four program area that we focus on. Agriculture, natural resources, uh, family, uh, and consumer sciences. Four eighth youth development, rural development and outreach. And we have our, uh, communication conferencing and technology area, which really support these four program areas are in agricultural, uh, livestock enterprises, uh, development, horticulture, organic certification, sustainable production system, uh, gap, good ag practices, good handling practices. We are really pushing this as we work with many, many of our small farmers. Uh, right now, you find, you, you, you'll find, you, you've probably seen pickups in a shopping center, parking lot, uh, somewhere on the corner selling produce. But one of the things that I strongly believe, and I constantly share that with my colleague, at some point, you're not gonna be able to do that. So GAP certification is, uh, is what we are really pushing, uh, not only through our corporate extension, but in, in partnership with, uh, Sarah as well. So we are very excited about the accomplishment there. We had seven producers to become GAP certified at the beginning of the year. So we are very, and then, then we have others which have inquired about becoming the GAP certified. Uh, aggro Unity is a group that's based out of, uh, meadow, Georgia. Uh, well actually headquarters out metal Georgia, uh, Henry Kennedy, the Kennedy Farm. And one of the things that our former dean, uh, Ralph Noble, who was an animal science who is an animal sciences, when working with the farmers that through aggro Unity and other farmers, they realized that there's an opportunity for small livestock producers to really make more, get more dollar, make, make more money for that, for, for their livestock. And as a result of that, uh, they pulled together many, many of the small producers, uh, and, and pulling the producers together. They had to, they had to do, man, their management skills, mainten skill, production skill, basically had had to learn how to, uh, uh, to, to look at raising that cow push, uh, to the weight, 650, 700 pounds, so you can get enough to, uh, uh, together to really make some dollars, uh, rather than taking it down the road to the local sales barn. And you are not going to get the mics for your, for, for your livestock. So that program has really taken off. We have really engaged a lot of producers throughout Georgia and, and something else is outside the state when it comes to, to the training. This is a workshop that was, uh, done once Saturday, I think. And these are some of the individuals that, that graduated and participated in that workshop. Uh, another thing that we did as a result of this, we, we was able to get the growers to become more involved in the, in the Georgia Cattle Association. So we are very, very excited about that because that's a learning opportunity for those small producers. Plastics, uh, we do a lot with plastics, especially in organic and beyond. So we are very excited about that. Uh, field demonstration. This is, this is, this is our, this is one of our farms. We have the main campus, and then we have another farm, which is about four miles away on Camp John Hope Road, if you've been to Fort Valley. Uh, this is about 800. We up by 800 something acres in this site, in this, in this site here for Family Consumer Sciences. Well, family Consumer sciences, uh, food safety, f np, expanded food, nutrition education program, family life, family resource management. And we engage students in what we call team, uh, teaching, uh, teaching enlightening, achieving the mentoring, the Team success program. We bring students to campus for a couple of weeks during the summer, and they have an opportunity to work with, with scientists and that, that has been wonderful. Uh, a mobile Nutrition and Health unit. Uh, many of you have seen our mobile Technology Information Technology Unit. I have a slide laid on a, if you have a, uh, it's an 18 wheeler. Uh, the one that we have, the mobile technology unit is an 18 wheeler, uh, 20 station computer lab. We've used that in Medicare training, uh, farmers training, youth training, senior citizen training that works. And it also certified with GMA and FEMA as well. So it's a, it's, it's a command station that we need if, if, if needed. But to take, to take it a step far further, and realizing the nut nutrition, nutritional challenges that we are having, especially in the rural, in, in these small rural, in the small, rural areas. Uh, we develop, we put together proposed, guided funded, uh, a few years, a few years back. And we are at the stage now where we are having a, a second, uh, 18 wheeler built. And it is, it would be used for nutrition and help study on that, on that, on that system. We will have, uh, a kitchen where we can do the food demonstration, uh, food preparation, and really targeting, uh, young, young, young parents. So we are excited about that. We was told that the delivery date would be in November. I'm telling people that it would be in December, just in case. Uh, our four H youth, uh, four, his youth development program. We focus on mentoring, healthy living, novice agriculture education. But definitely we spend a lot of time on mentoring and also a lot of time on healthy living. Uh, if you have not visited the Village Community Garden in Sylvester, Georgia, if you, if you're through, if you're through there, and if you need to go outta your way, stop by sometime and visit that, that garden. Uh, we was a part, a part of the a, uh, the, the initiation of that, of that project. And it just had, it has taken off tremendously. We have a lot of volunteers, not only throughout Georgia, but also throughout, throughout the country, uh, through at the Village Community Garden, uh, Mr. Woody Huge, who, uh, is our four H program leader, and Mr. Hughes working with, uh, Sam X, Sam White, and his family at the Village Community Garden. Uh, we do, uh, uh, art Archer. We have Muscadines, we have blue bears, we have the boss garden, we have the, the bed with the plastic. And also it has expanded into other opportunities on site. Uh, we do a lot of training, and as a result of our involvement with the Village Community Garden and other vi other individuals seeing the Village Community Garden, uh, turn around. Columbus is another, uh, outreach project that deal deal with youth. So we are involved with Turnaround Columbus, but we are excited about these opportunities. And now, uh, charter Chattahoochee Hill School in South, south Fulton, where they're also with, and as well as a lot of other, other, uh, schools in, uh, organizations, our community development and outreach, uh, uh, area, uh, as we indicated, we focus a lot on the community. And as you can see here, we have the three agency heads located, located here at an outreach activity. Uh, and so as a result of that, from the agricultural perspective, uh, we've, we engaged a lot of individuals from the, from the small area, as well as from the other urban area that's interested in in farming, uh, progress. This is a magazine that our team put together just, uh, just recently. Uh, why did we do that? One of the, one of the things that we have, have heard over the years and also seen over the years, are the challenges that many of the small farmers have. Many of the small African American farmers have had, uh, with, uh, a lot of the government agencies. So what we decided to do was to interview several,",

And also, uh, miss, uh, Mason is from, from, from, from Nala Geo. Napal Geo Nala, Georgia. Uh, th this is what, this is what the, the book looked like, cover the seven farmers that we interviewed. We asked them about the different programs, the U S D A programs that they're involved in. As you can see here, she's involved in the price, the price loss coverage program, the P L C farm operating alone, and what, and what, what we ask them to do to just tell their story, how these programs benefit their organization. And you, you we're trying to make sure you get a copy of that so you can see it for yourself. Uh, so we are very excited about, about that opportunity. Uh, solar Farm, uh, we have a, we have 40, uh, this with Georgia Power. We have a, we have a colla, a collaborative relationship with Georgia Power. Uh, as a result of that relationship, uh, we put in a solar farm on, on the campus. And as you can see here, this is 47 acres of panels. And, and the, the, the panels capture the energy. And there's a, a lift station, uh, in the north, in the north, uh, the north, north, north, the northeast corner. So it is piped by to the lift station and back, and then to the transmission to, to the transmission line. So this, so, so, so this, this goes to the grid. Now, as part of that conversation with Georgia Power, uh, the gentleman with the mic, Dr. Cedric Ogden, who is an engineer and also an extension specialist, uh, was able to negotiate with Georgia Power for this training station demonstration site. This is for the, at this demonstration site, we are able to show students, uh, we are able to show farmers, uh, based on how the system works. Uh, the, we have, we have panels which are different at different, uh, position, a different location. And we also have a tracking panel. The one in the center is a tracking panel as well. So we have, we have all of those, uh, panels there. And farmers, uh, student would get an opportunity, they would get an opportunity to really, uh, assemble, uh, a, a system as well. And, but, but it's not, it's not hot when they sem when they are assembling it. So, and we, the energy that generated from this, this, this demonstration site is, uh, shun to, uh, uh, a grid close by. And what we are able to do, we are able to measure, uh, the difference in the energy from the, from, from, from what is shut to the grid based on what supplies the energy. Uh, to, to my left of this site, or to your right of this site, uh, we have, uh, an outdoors, uh, vegetable processing processing facility. So, so we have two coolers. Uh, so we are, we are able to really, really see the energy for the demonstration. The producers and the students are able to see the difference in the energy. Uh, this is our ag Technology conference center. If you are planning a meeting in south, in, uh, central Georgia and want to just get away, be in the countryside, enjoy the bird singing, uh, before you go in and have your meeting, uh, you, I mean, you, you would enjoy the, the, the, uh, the large the area. We can, we can, we can, we can, uh, house, uh, about a hundred and I mean, we can, we can accommodate in, in the lower site. There are about a, about 140 people at a meeting of this nature, at a banquet type setting. And the house, the house is a, is a, is a night early 1900 farm house. It came with the farm when we purchased it. And if you, if you are visiting and walked across the floors on the, on the, on the on and walk across the floors, if it screes, if the floor scree, let me know. We let me know. Uh, I'll buy you lunch. Uh, this, this is our information technology unit that I mentioned earlier. So, so what, what's this unit? As I indicated, we have a small force per se, but units like the one that we have here, the mobile technology unit, have really expanded our reach. And we, it is, is cons. It is constantly on the road. So we are very excited about, about that, uh, as a result of having that unit. Uh, just recently, uh, Terence Alt, who is our assistant administrator for that area, uh, received a grant from the national tele, uh, telecommunication Information Administration agency for a project targeting minority communities. And those communities are, look, we are looking at Crawford County, Macon County, and Peach County. So that was about two point right at $3 million. So we are very excited about that. And as a result of having that grant, uh, conversation taking place with, uh, at t to look at refurbishing some computers for, for youth in, in the, in the rural area here, we, we, we, we, thinking in terms of 100 computers, K through 12, uh, in a, in a few weeks, uh, we'll be at Sunbelt in Moultrie, uh, when you visit Sunbelt and Moultrie, uh, stop by our house. Uh, we will have at certain times, I think 11 o'clock and maybe two, we will have some dairy goat ice cream. And we're gonna try, we are going to try to have some, some, uh, burgers as well. We haven't had burgers since the pandemic, but we have, we had the ice cream last year. So we are, we are, we are located, uh, in what we call the university row. And the university row. You have Georgia, you have Florida, you have the Spotlight Building, and you have Fort Valley State. Uh, if you're an Auburn fan, uh, you are down the street their way. So I, I don't, I don't know why they, how they planned it like that, but that's the way, that's the way it was. That's the way it is. Uh, in the College of Agriculture, we also have, uh, head Start units and the Head Start units are housed out of the college. We have a unit in, in Cordia. We have a, we have a, a site in Cordia. We have a site in, in, uh, doula County, vna. Uh, we have a site in Macon County, Marshville, and we have a site in, uh, in Taylor County. Uh, no, no, yeah, yeah. Taylor, Taylor County. So with this, we we're able to reach out and provide services to, to youth, to, to students in those areas. And it has been very useful because, uh, uh, in Cordell particular Chris County, uh, it is, it is located in the community where, well, we are excited about the location because it provide an opportunity for parents to either just walk across the street in a lot of instances to, to take their kids to school. So we we're excited about those, those opportunities. Uh, we do have farm visits. Uh, you see one of your, one of your colleagues there. Uh, and the purpose of the farm visits is, uh, basically to let let the farmers, uh, uh, yeah, represent Gillard and Congressman Bishop. Uh, with these farms tours, we, we were able, we are able to, we was able to learn a lot and see what we need to do in order to step up our program as well. So we are very, very excited about those opportunities. Uh, are there any questions? We do have a few questions. Thank you for that presentation. Mm-hmm. Uh, chair recognized representative Al Williams. Thank you. I enjoyed your presentation. Yes, sir. And in case time runs out before, I wanted to thank both of our chairmans for a great meeting. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's been very informative, but two questions I have for you. The first one is to clarify the names of a particular fruit. And according to a wise gentleman who happened to be the father of Representative Finn Houston. Houston, if it's $3 a pound, they call pecans, uh, pecans. If they 30 cents a pound, they p can They pick can. Right. That's where they are. Good, good. Tell me please, uh, about the Colorado meat judging you. You didn't say Colorado was, was listed there. Y'all go out there to look at some Colorado beef. They, they, they took, uh, our student went out to, uh, to answer your question, yes, uh, actually it was, and, and it was processed. They, they, they, they were judging, judging process processed beef. Yeah. And it, it was, I don't, I think it was a conference, uh, where the students, uh, participate in that conference. Okay. And that was the first time. Alright. That was interesting. Thank you So much, much, uh, great presentation. I didn't realize you were doing the, all of the things that you're doing there. That's fantastic. The only thing I did not see in your presentation was about one of my favorite programs on tv, critter Fixers. And they, they always talk about Fort Valley. Oh, they Are. They, they, they both graduated from through our veterinary technology program. And, uh, they come back occasionally. And so they really, they really have, they really have grown, expanded and, uh, and, and represent and represent the university well. Yeah,",
